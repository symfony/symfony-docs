Thanks for proposing this fix! I have some questions about this:

* Is this the version number used by MariaDB itself (to differentiate from MySQL) or is this just a Doctrine feature?
* If it's a Doctrine feature, is it a temporary solution until Doctrine 3 is released or is it definitive?

I ask this because, even if I disagree with lots of the decisions made by Doctrine members, I admit that they always try to do things technically correct and this solution feels a bit "hacky". My main concern is that the `$version` option now behaves differently depending on your database: most of the times is just the "version number" but other times is the "vendor name" + the "version number".

Thanks!

The version itself (`10.2.12`) is the version from MariaDB server, but the prefix (`mariadb-`) seems to be a Doctrine feature to differentiate from MySQL.

For the rest of your question I guess you'll have to ask to a Doctrine maintainer
