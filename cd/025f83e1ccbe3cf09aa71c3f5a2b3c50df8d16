`components/http_kernel/introduction` already has an overview of all these events. Internal listeners are listed there and a full list in `reference/dic_tags#kernel-event-listener`.

So we basically already have this info, we maybe just have to group them on a bit more logical place (the list in full dic_tags isn't a very nice location imo).

@WouterJ considering your comments, maybe the best thing is to actually create that new reference document to group all events.

Should the redirection map be updated to avoid having a 404 on this URL ?

@stof Good idea! I've just added a redirection to the new events reference document.

Great job @javiereguiluz! This really shows that rewritting the docs and removing things can bring the docs to a higher level.

I think we should add a table listing all priorities used by framework listeners (just move it from the dic_tags reference). This would make it very easy to determine which priority you should use for a custom listener.

Btw, there also seems to be a build failure.

As suggested, I've moved the tables about built-in event listeners from DIC Tags reference to the new Events reference.

Do you have any other suggestions or can we consider this PR as *finished*? Thanks.

You have to remove the reference to the stable API chapter from the `/book/index.rst` file.

@xabbuh done!

The same also applies to `/book/map.rst.inc`.

@xabbuh done! I'm sorry for not doing it right at first :(

Hi @javiereguiluz. Can you please rebase?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2015-05-22T16:09:18Z

@WouterJ done. Let's see if conflicts are gone now.
