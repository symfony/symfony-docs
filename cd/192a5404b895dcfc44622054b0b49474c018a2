Is it really a common use case to access environment variables through the superglobal arrays? I usually reference them inside my service configuration with `%env(...)%` instead (values are injected into services this way instead of having code depend on global state).

I wouldn't say it is "common" but this is something that can happen, especially when using the Dotenv component as a standalone. But I may add a note to inform that best practices is to inject env vars through `%env()%` maybe?

I think I would put it the other way around: Show examples how to make use of the env processor in the DI config and add a short sentence explaining that you *could* also access the value through the superglobal arrays.

I moved the paragraph below the examples with `%env()%` and reworded a bit to indicates that env vars _may_ be accessed in the code. Is it better? ðŸ™‚
