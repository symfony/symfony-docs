build should get green when retrying, as the code is now merged to 6.2.

Please also adjust the title of the PR after rebasing, thanks

rebased, cleaned up and adjusted the title.

regarding the linter failure: looks like thats broken in all 6.x versions: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/actions/runs/3160768594/jobs/5145596113

can you fix that in 6.0 and then merge it up to 6.1 and 6.2? or we just merge with the known error...
