Nice! :+1: I'd tweak it a bit and I'd remove the version number to leave it as follows:

```
$ composer require ircmaxell/password-compat
```

I agree. There's little risk a compatibility package releases a new major version containing BC breaks. Though if we wanted to keep a version, I would use `~1.0` or something similar instead.

I'd use:

```
composer require ircmaxell/password-compat:~1.0
```

Done, branch ``2.3`` is ok?

I actually do not like the version (note that the comment of me you linked was talking about a root package install, otherwise we often omit the version number).

However, if we want to use the version, we should change it to this to have Windows compability:
```bash
$ composer require ircmaxell/password-compat "~1.0"
```
