The config references surely needs some love, thanks for starting this!

@timglabisch You should nest the different code blocks into a `configuration-block` directive.

please rereview.

@WouterJ @xabbuh can you take a look at this PR, whats missing?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by timglabisch at 2015-01-12T22:56:40Z

@xabbuh i changed the namespace, please review

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@timglabisch However, maybe we should consider to add this in the bundle and not here given the discussion in https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4719#issuecomment-68607811.

@xabbuh i think it depends on how fast this PR is mergeable. i love the idea to move the doctrine bundle configuration to the DoctrineBundle, but merging this PR wouldn't prevent us from moving the documentation later on.

@xabbuh i rebased this branch against the master.

@xabbuh please review

Thank you @timglabisch. Looks good to me. :+1:

Hi Tim!

Thanks for this! I just left a lot of comments, but it's more because this configuration is confusing, with all the `is_bundle` stuff and how behaviors change (which I'm guessing, is why you decided to document it). Anyways, for me, it wasn't quite clear yet - so I added some suggestions. Please make any changes that make sense and ask any questions.

Cheers!

@weaverryan the doctrine configuration here is a bit weird, can you please rereview this? i did some additional changes to make this more clear.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey Tim!

Thanks for the awesome-fast turn-around. I just added some more notes. Ultimately, we may need to re-make this PR against `DoctrineBundle`, as we've decided to keep this configuration file in *their* repository. Let's perfect this first, then re-make it over there.

Thanks!

thanks @weaverryan please rereview this PR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ping @WouterJ @xabbuh

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by timglabisch at 2015-02-24T23:02:01Z

@WouterJ fixed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by weaverryan at 2015-02-26T13:19:58Z

This looks great to me. Now, we really need this to go into the DoctrineBundle itself: https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/configuration.rst. @timglabisch can you duplicate this PR over there?

We also need finish "moving" the configuration section to that repository. It looks like our reference section may still have some stuff that their's doesn't. We need to make sure everything we have is in their configuration section, then replace our reference section with a link to their docs.

Thanks!

@weaverryan shouldn't we just merge this one?
