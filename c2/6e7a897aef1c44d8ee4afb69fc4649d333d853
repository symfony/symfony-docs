The PR was intended this way. In symfony/symfony#32133 we introduced the ability to configure the magic methods behavior through a new bitwise flag with Symfony 5.2. We forgot to update this place while changing the one somewhere below in the document.

#15080 targets the `5.x` branch to account for the additional bitwise flag introduced in symfony/symfony#39693 for 5.3.
