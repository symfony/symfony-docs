Hi @l-vo 👋 ,

first of all thanks for your contribution.
Can you explain a bit why we should change it this way? To me its less readable.

Cheers 🙏

Hi @OskarStark :)

Some examples used context constants and some others not. I thought it was an oversight for the examples that didn't use constants. Furthermore I think using constants in the doc allows to advise the developpers that context constants exist and that they should use them instead of magic strings.

Thank you for your feedback!
Personally I am against using the constants here, but let’s see what the other say.

I'd say we should do this ... but it's sad that the constants are so long and ugly 😢

@javiereguiluz this should go into 3.4, right?
