I'm new here, but I think should be change the buffered explanation with the new handler deduplicated (The ``deduplicated`` handler simply keeps...)

(by the way, I really dislike the "deduplication" word ... but that's something we cannot change)

I agree with @Txumari here, after this code block we talk about the buffered handler a couple times. We should change it to deduplicated handler (and also change the description).

Should we mantain some information about the `buffer` handler? its still a valid handler according to https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/02-handlers-formatters-processors.md#wrappers--special-handlers but honestly the `deduplication` handler does also the buffering + deduplication of messages. The final example use the `group` and `buffer`.

I've updated the explanation and fixed the mentions of the `buffered` handler, also changed the last example in the doc, that talked about combining the handlers to store the messages on the server and also send the logs by email.
