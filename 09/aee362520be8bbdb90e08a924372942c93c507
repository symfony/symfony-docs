I suggest to wait for symfony/symfony#34020 before finishing this one :)

For the reference, I'm waiting on symfony/symfony#34139 as well before finishing this article. I think we should then have the complete picture (and it's a nice picture!)

Unlocked now that symfony/symfony#34139 has been merged

Should also fix #12612
