@Nyholm do you think this can be achieved by fabbot? Otherwise I am afraid, we cannot think of it all the time

Regarding commit messages, are you aware of the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec? It has a nice syntax and some tools already implement it ([GitHub bots checking message formats](https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests), [changelog generators](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), linters, [IDE plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit) etc).

For Symfony commit messages following this spec would look like:

```
feat(serializer): add support for foo
```

```
fix(dependency-injection): add missing type hint for bar
```

```
fix(cache)!: remove function foo()

BREAKING CHANGE: function foo() has been removed to fix a security issue
```

TBH, that's looks really ugly :) And we already have tools built around our conventions.
