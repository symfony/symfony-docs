How to Create Symfony Diagrams
==============================

Creating the Diagram
--------------------

* Use [Dia][1] as the diagramming application;
* Use [PT Sans Narrow][2] as the only font in all diagrams (if possible, use
  only the "normal" weight for all contents);
* Use 36pt as the base font size;
* Use 0.10 cm width for lines and shape borders;
* Use the following color palette:
  * Text, lines and shape borders: black (#000000)
  * Shape backgrounds:
    * Grays: dark (#4d4d4d), medium (#b3b3b3), light (#f2f2f2)
    * Blue: #b2d4eb
    * Red: #ecbec0
    * Green: #b2dec7
    * Orange: #fddfbb

In case of doubt, check the existing diagrams or ask to the
[Symfony Documentation Team][3].

Saving and Exporting the Diagram
--------------------------------

* Save the original diagram in `*.dia` format in `_images/sources/<folder-name>`;
* Export the diagram to SVG format and save it in `_images/<folder-name>`.

Including the Diagram in the Symfony Docs
-----------------------------------------

Use the following snippet to embed the diagram in the docs:

```
.. raw:: html

    <object data="../_images/<folder-name>/<diagram-file-name>.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
```

Reasoning
---------

* Dia was chosen because it's one of the few applications which are free, open
  source and compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows.
* Font, colors and line widths were chosen to be similar to the diagrams used
  in the best tech books.

Troubleshooting
---------------

* On some macOS systems, Dia cannot be executed as a regular application and
  you must run the following console command instead:
  `export DISPLAY=:0 && /Applications/Dia.app/Contents/Resources/bin/dia`
