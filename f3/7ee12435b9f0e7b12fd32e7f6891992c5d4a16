I think this change makes sense. Maybe drop the "` Cloud`" suffixes from the headings (for Azure and Heroku). Also, maybe just inline the links to the official docs? Otherwise it just takes people to a one-line article that only has an external link. Or is that for keeping existing URLs intact?

Agree, duplicated content makes not much sense.
We are updating our Symfony guides right now for 3.4 / 4.0.
