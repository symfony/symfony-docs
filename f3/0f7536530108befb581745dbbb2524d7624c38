I think it's a bit too long for the book chapter and a bit too short in the config reference. What do you think about moving the information about the `logging` setting to the config reference and replacing the book section with a simple `.. note::`, including a reference to the config reference?

Can you add [WCM] (which means Waiting Code Merge) to the pull request title?
