The UPGRADE guide doesn't say anything about this change: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/UPGRADE-2.8.md :confused:

@javiereguiluz I'm not sure where this PR should be merged to, but FieldError class is not found in Symfony project anywhere.
But I'm guessing this class had been introduced in a early stage of development, thereafter renamed.

This change is 100% correct and a left-over from way before Symfony 2.0.0: https://github.com/symfony/Form/commit/889a1600e6aa878331be8da65a4dac0210801dcb

So big :+1: and thanks @issei-m for finding & fixing this very old issue.
