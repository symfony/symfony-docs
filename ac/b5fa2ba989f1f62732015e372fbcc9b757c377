This is security-related, so we'd like to merge this as soon as possible. @wouterj could you please check these proposed changes? Thanks!

What if we simply do not show the use of multiple attributes here, but use an expression which checks if the user is granted at least one of them to avoid the ambiguity here?

The main problem for me is that in YAML and PHP configuration formats, the key is called `roles` instead of `role` so I prefer to have it properly documented.

Maybe we could add an advice to use an expressiÃ³n and avoid further problems.

After #15503 is merged, we'll need to check if this is still relevant and if we need to fix it. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz #15503 is merged and I think this is still relevant. I've rebased the PR.
