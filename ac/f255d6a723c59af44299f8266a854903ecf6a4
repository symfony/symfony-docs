Maybe it's better to use symlinks than moving the bundle references around.

Well, that'll be replaced by using sparse checkout, I just couldn't get it working yesterday.

@WouterJ I'm unable to open a PR to your fork. Can you pull this? https://github.com/tvlooy/symfony-docs/commit/b0e54128180bfdf3cca238c8696ac01a36875df8 That should work.

FYI, I also tried with git-archive, which is able to download a directory from a repository but unfortunately GitHub doesn't allow git-archive requests. And I also tried with the SVN support which works too, but for some reason it downloads the directory for all tags and  branches. So, you end up with a much much bigger download. Anyway, git sparse checkout work :-)
