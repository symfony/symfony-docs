@weaverryan before merging, I first want your opinion on this :)

@WouterJ Hmm, I like your point - the literals make things stand out, which can be bad for reading. So I definitely support this! In some cases, the bundle is referring to a directory, and in that case it should still have the literals. But I noticed that you did exactly this in your PR, so nice work :).
