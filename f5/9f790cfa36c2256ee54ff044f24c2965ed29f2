@kraynel I agree with you ... but the proposed change is also confusing, because *"[...] will be unserializable"* can mean both *"we can unserialize() it"* and *"it's non-serializable, so we can't get transformed it back to its original contents"*.

I'm going to merge your pull request and reword it a bit while merging to say: *"... the message can't be unserialized."*
