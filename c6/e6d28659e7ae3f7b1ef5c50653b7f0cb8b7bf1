Thank you for the pull request, @raziel057. This is a really good catch! I just left you two little comments. After fixing them, the pull request is ready to be merged.

Sorry @raziel057, I forgot to review this PR some weeks ago. I've now added one little comment, after it, I'll flag it as finished and someone can merge it :)

@WouterJ I changed the ``trim()`` to the ``:phpfunction:`trim``` role as suggested in the defualt option too. Is it ok for you?
