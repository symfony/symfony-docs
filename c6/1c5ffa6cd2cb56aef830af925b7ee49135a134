@Toflar thanks a lot for this contribution! It's perfectly explained and it's easy to follow.

However, I made some rewords to make the explanations more concise. We do this routinely not only for the readers, but also for us, to make contents easier to maintain. Thanks!

It's perfectly fine. Rewording by the same people makes sure the readers have a consistent reading experience, it's perfect! Thank you very much!

BTW: What's the policy to use `.. versionadded:: 4.1`? Should we maybe also use that here?

We include a `.. versionadded::` for all new features and also for deprecations. And yes, we should use it here and that's why I included at the end, just after the code example that uses the new feature ðŸ˜„
