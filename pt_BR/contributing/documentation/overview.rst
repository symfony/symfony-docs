Contributing to the Documentation
=================================

Documentation is as important as code. It follows the exact same principles:
DRY, tests, ease of maintenance, extensibility, optimization, and refactoring
just to name a few. And of course, documentation has bugs, typos, hard to read
tutorials, and more.

Contributing
------------

Before contributing, you need to become familiar with the :doc:`markup
language <format>` used by the documentation.

The Symfony2 documentation is hosted in a Git repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs.git

If you want to submit a patch, clone the official documentation repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs.git

.. note::
  The Symfony2 documentation is licensed under a Creative Commons
  Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported :doc:`License <license>`.

Reporting an Issue
------------------

The most easy contribution you can make is reporting issues: a typo, a grammar
mistake, a bug in code example, a missing explanation, and so on.

Steps:

* Submit a bug in the bug tracker;

* *(optional)* Submit a patch.

Translating
-----------

Read the dedicated :doc:`document <translations>`.
