@stof I assumed you meant the `getMessageData()` method [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4723/files#r22430870). `getMessageParameters()` does not exist.

ping @weaverryan @WouterJ I think this is something we should merge as soon as possible to avoid giving insecure advices.

Thanks @xabbuh. I'm actually not familiar with this - I knew this approach could leak info, but had the approach you suggested always worked, or is it new? Where did the idea come from? Forgive my lack of knowledge here :)

@stof made the suggestion in https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4723#discussion_r22430870. These methods are present in Symfony 2.3 too: http://api.symfony.com/2.3/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Exception/AuthenticationException.html

@weaverryan this is a feature added in Symfony 2.2

@xabbuh indeed, I made a mistake when giving the method name (I haven't checked the code or the api doc when commenting)

@stof No problem, was not hard to guess the right method name. ;)
