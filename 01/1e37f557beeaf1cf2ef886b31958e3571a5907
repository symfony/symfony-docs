Each time a minor ("standard") version is released, you will have 2 months to upgrade (the same as before if you cared about bug fixes). The overall idea is that, thanks to the BC policy, upgrading minor versions is safe, simple and quick.

I propose to fix this in 4.4 branch (or master) to avoid confusion with earlier Symfony versions.

Makes sense to merge it in 4.4 instead.
