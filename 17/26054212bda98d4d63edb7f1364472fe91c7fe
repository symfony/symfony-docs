@harikt It's ok, I can patch it in - so no worries!

@weaverryan thanks. Is this the way to contribute http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/documentation/overview.html ? Just learning.

@harikt That's it! But we don't expect everyone to read all of that. If we spot something wrong, we (nicely) let you know :).

I'm not sure if I like this change though...

The section is only showing some basic features of Symfony2 and compares them to the current project set-up, to show that Symfony really makes your app more simple.

@WouterJ if you go through the code it will be nice for people who are not familiar with distribution bundle to get linked to the file `web/app.php` . ie it.

If you don't like you can ignore and close the PR.

Hmm, I see Wouter's point - @harikt I think you are probably not the average reader of this page - I would expect more beginners (but who knows!). Would it make sense to link to a page in the docs that shows you how to actually get your project started using the Symfony Standard Edition? Or would that *not* be helpful for what you were looking for @harikt?

Thanks!

@weaverryan

> I would expect more beginners (but who knows!)

who knows who reads :-) . Just a suggestion if they don't know from where the

```php
require_once __DIR__.'/../app/bootstrap.php';
require_once __DIR__.'/../app/AppKernel.php';
```

code comes.

May be after the heading `The Sample Application in Symfony` a link to install / configure symfony for the rest of the section? http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/from_flat_php_to_symfony2.html#the-sample-application-in-symfony

Hmm, I'm now liking it more than I did before. (I've read a bit more context this time). I'll label it as Finished and see if @weaverryan changed its mind too :)
