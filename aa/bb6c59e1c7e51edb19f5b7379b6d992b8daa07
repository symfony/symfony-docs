Thanks for opening this.
I think we could mention as well the [`ValidationStamp`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.1/src/Symfony/Component/Messenger/Stamp/ValidationStamp.php) to configure validation groups. It's already mentioned in [this part](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.html#adding-metadata-to-messages-envelopes), but this possibility would be more discoverable next to the validation middleware samples.
