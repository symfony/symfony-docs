The code is merged, so this can be merged too, right?

@xabbuh Do you want me to add the doc for https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/30358 here since it's related and not yet merged?

@fancyweb Would be nice if you could do that.

@xabbuh Done!

Status: Needs Review

@OskarStark Added the "versionadded" directives at the end of each option block. I had to take a decision because their position in the current documentation is not really consistent.
