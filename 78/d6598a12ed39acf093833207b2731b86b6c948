Hi. This fix just for documentation.
At this point [https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html#transports](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html#transports)
at first configuration block `# config/packages/messenger.yaml` (xml/php) variable name is correct,
but at the second `# .env` it is not.

MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN variable is defined by Messenger Component.
[https://github.com/symfony/recipes/blob/master/symfony/messenger/4.1/manifest.json](https://github.com/symfony/recipes/blob/master/symfony/messenger/4.1/manifest.json)

Great! Thanks for the explanation. I now understand it. The env var is only defined in the recipe and I was looking for in the source code of Symfony ðŸ˜“

Thanks a lot for fixing this issue ... and congrats on your first Symfony Docs contribution!
