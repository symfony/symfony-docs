Regarding the Spanish translation, [this comment posted by the main translator](https://github.com/gitnacho/symfony-docs-es/issues/1#issuecomment-51293963) says: *"this project is no longer updated, but most of its contents are probably valid"*. So it's safe to assume that the Spanish translation is no longer active.
