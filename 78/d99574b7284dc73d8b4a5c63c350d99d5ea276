@sevjan thanks for this contribution.

I know it looks a bit weird at first, but the current text (without the capitalized `A`) is the correct way of writing this title. The reason is that we use "Title Case" and one of the rules is: _"short prepositions (a, to, at, etc.) are not capitalized"_

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case

So, we're closing this one without merging, but we're looking forward to your next contributions. Thanks!

I'm reopening this PR because I'm an idiot 😊

As you can see, I "explained" to you which are the title-case rules ... but you already followed those instructions to fix the current issue 🤦

I'm sorry 🙏  Let's merge this.
