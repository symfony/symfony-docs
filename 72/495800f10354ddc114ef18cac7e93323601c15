This is done for automatically when you're using the Symfony framework and is only something you should care about if you're using the Form component in a standalone project.

But as this is the main guide everyone will read, I agree with removing it here, it'll only cause confusion.

So thanks for reporting & fixing confusing bits of the docs! :+1:
