Do we really need a full article for this theme? Couldn't this be integrated into the existing page where we list all the available form themes?

The thing is that Bootstrap is extremely special and popular. Fun fact: this article published on symfony.com blog in 2014 is still our most popular blog post ever by an infinite difference: https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-2-6-bootstrap-form-theme  Bootstrap is just incredibly popular, so I like the idea of a short and practical guide for it (and not for other frameworks).

Thank you for the feedback and reviews.

I've considered to make it as a part as an existing page. But it was too many things that were special with bootstrap 4. Also this https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/26331 will be a special symfony/boostrap feature.
