According to https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/46315#issuecomment-1123524371 the patch should be merged into 6.1 branch.
P.S. Whereby I think that the patch could also be merged into 5.4.

Sorry I misread the PR header, you introduce the ability to set it via DSN in 6.1, but as its freezes, it should target 6.2 üëç
