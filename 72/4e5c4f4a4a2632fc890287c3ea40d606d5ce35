@javiereguiluz when we merge this, will the guide link automatically disappear on symfony.com (for 4.0 only)? Or does more work need to be done for that?

@wouterj Oh no!!! I completely ran over your work :/. I'm sorry. My vote is still to merge this PR... because (as nice as your article is), it doesn't contain a *lot* of content (I like the details on `dump()`, but we should show that elsewhere, and I also have seen that almost everyone knows about this function... somehow).

@javiereguiluz if you still agree with this proposal, could you remove the Debugging entry from symfony.com? Thanks for removing the other sections on my other PR :)

ping @javiereguiluz!

This is not super important, but I'd love to finish it :)

I've removed the link to "Debug" ... it will be online after the next deploy. Thanks!
