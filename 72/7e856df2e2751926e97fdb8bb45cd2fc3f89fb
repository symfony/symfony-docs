I do not understand this change. Both URLs end with the same section being displayed for me.

@xabbuh in `components/dependency_injection/compilation.rst` you have this:

```rst
[...]

.. _creating-a-compiler-pass:
.. _components-di-compiler-pass:

Execute Code During Compilation
-------------------------------

[...]

.. _components-di-separate-compiler-passes:

Creating Separate Compiler Passes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[...]
```

Both references are different ... and this PR changes the link from the first one to the second one. Is this correct?

Thanks for the clarification. I was actually confused by the links from the PR description.
