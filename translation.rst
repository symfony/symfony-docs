Translations
============

The term "internationalization" (often abbreviated `i18n`_) refers to the
process of abstracting strings and other locale-specific pieces out of your
application into a layer where they can be translated and converted based
on the user's locale (i.e. language and country). For text, this means
wrapping each with a function capable of translating the text (or "message")
into the language of the user::

    // text will *always* print out in English
    dump('Hello World');
    die();

    // text can be translated into the end-user's language or
    // default to English
    dump($translator->trans('Hello World'));
    die();

.. note::

    The term *locale* refers roughly to the user's language and country. It
    can be any string that your application uses to manage translations and
    other format differences (e.g. currency format). The `ISO 639-1`_
    *language* code, an underscore (``_``), then the `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2`_
    *country* code (e.g. ``fr_FR`` for French/France) is recommended.

In this chapter, you'll learn how to use the Translation component in the
Symfony Framework. You can read the
:doc:`Translation component documentation </components/translation/usage>`
to learn even more. Overall, the process has several steps:

#. :ref:`Enable and configure <translation-configuration>` Symfony's
   translation service;

#. Abstract strings (i.e. "messages") by wrapping them in calls to the
   ``Translator`` (":ref:`translation-basic`");

#. :ref:`Create translation resources/files <translation-resources>`
   for each supported locale that translate each message in the application;

#. Determine, :doc:`set and manage the user's locale </translation/locale>`
   for the request and optionally
   :doc:`on the user's entire session </session/locale_sticky_session>`.

.. _translation-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Translations are handled by a ``translator`` service that uses the user's
locale to lookup and return translated messages. Before using it, enable the
``translator`` in your configuration:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        framework:
            translator: { fallbacks: [en] }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:framework="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony/symfony-1.0.xsd">

            <framework:config>
                <framework:translator>
                    <framework:fallback>en</framework:fallback>
                </framework:translator>
            </framework:config>
        </container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('framework', array(
            'translator' => array('fallbacks' => array('en')),
        ));

See :ref:`translation-fallback` for details on the ``fallbacks`` key
and what Symfony does when it doesn't find a translation.

The locale used in translations is the one stored on the request. This is
typically set via a ``_locale`` attribute on your routes (see :ref:`translation-locale-url`).

.. _translation-basic:

Basic Translation
-----------------

Translation of text is done through the  ``translator`` service
(:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Translation\\Translator`). To translate a block
of text (called a *message*), use the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Translation\\Translator::trans` method. Suppose,
for example, that you're translating a simple message from inside a controller::

    // ...
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    public function indexAction()
    {
        $translated = $this->get('translator')->trans('Symfony is great');

        return new Response($translated);
    }

.. _translation-resources:

When this code is executed, Symfony will attempt to translate the message
"Symfony is great" based on the ``locale`` of the user. For this to work,
you need to tell Symfony how to translate the message via a "translation
resource", which is usually a file that contains a collection of translations
for a given locale. This "dictionary" of translations can be created in several
different formats, XLIFF being the recommended format:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- messages.fr.xlf -->
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <xliff version="1.2" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2">
            <file source-language="en" datatype="plaintext" original="file.ext">
                <body>
                    <trans-unit id="symfony_is_great">
                        <source>Symfony is great</source>
                        <target>J'aime Symfony</target>
                    </trans-unit>
                </body>
            </file>
        </xliff>

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # messages.fr.yml
        Symfony is great: J'aime Symfony

    .. code-block:: php

        // messages.fr.php
        return array(
            'Symfony is great' => 'J\'aime Symfony',
        );

For information on where these files should be located, see
:ref:`translation-resource-locations`.

Now, if the language of the user's locale is French (e.g. ``fr_FR`` or ``fr_BE``),
the message will be translated into ``J'aime Symfony``. You can also translate
the message inside your :ref:`templates <translation-tags>`.

The Translation Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To actually translate the message, Symfony uses a simple process:

* The ``locale`` of the current user, which is stored on the request is determined;

* A catalog (e.g. big collection) of translated messages is loaded from translation
  resources defined for the ``locale`` (e.g. ``fr_FR``). Messages from the
  :ref:`fallback locale <translation-fallback>` are also loaded and
  added to the catalog if they don't already exist. The end result is a large
  "dictionary" of translations.

* If the message is located in the catalog, the translation is returned. If
  not, the translator returns the original message.

When using the ``trans()`` method, Symfony looks for the exact string inside
the appropriate message catalog and returns it (if it exists).

Message Placeholders
--------------------

Sometimes, a message containing a variable needs to be translated::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    public function indexAction($name)
    {
        $translated = $this->get('translator')->trans('Hello '.$name);

        return new Response($translated);
    }

However, creating a translation for this string is impossible since the translator
will try to look up the exact message, including the variable portions
(e.g. *"Hello Ryan"* or *"Hello Fabien"*).

For details on how to handle this situation, see :ref:`component-translation-placeholders`
in the components documentation. For how to do this in templates, see :ref:`translation-tags`.

Pluralization
-------------

Another complication is when you have translations that may or may not be
plural, based on some variable:

.. code-block:: text

    There is one apple.
    There are 5 apples.

To handle this, use the :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Translation\\Translator::transChoice`
method or the ``transchoice`` tag/filter in your :ref:`template <translation-tags>`.

For much more information, see :ref:`component-translation-pluralization`
in the Translation component documentation.

Translations in Templates
-------------------------

Most of the time, translation occurs in templates. Symfony provides native
support for both Twig and PHP templates.

.. _translation-tags:

Twig Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symfony provides specialized Twig tags (``trans`` and ``transchoice``) to
help with message translation of *static blocks of text*:

.. code-block:: twig

    {% trans %}Hello %name%{% endtrans %}

    {% transchoice count %}
        {0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf[ There are %count% apples
    {% endtranschoice %}

The ``transchoice`` tag automatically gets the ``%count%`` variable from
the current context and passes it to the translator. This mechanism only
works when you use a placeholder following the ``%var%`` pattern.

.. caution::

    The ``%var%`` notation of placeholders is required when translating in
    Twig templates using the tag.

.. tip::

    If you need to use the percent character (``%``) in a string, escape it by
    doubling it: ``{% trans %}Percent: %percent%%%{% endtrans %}``

You can also specify the message domain and pass some additional variables:

.. code-block:: twig

    {% trans with {'%name%': 'Fabien'} from "app" %}Hello %name%{% endtrans %}

    {% trans with {'%name%': 'Fabien'} from "app" into "fr" %}Hello %name%{% endtrans %}

    {% transchoice count with {'%name%': 'Fabien'} from "app" %}
        {0} %name%, there are no apples|{1} %name%, there is one apple|]1,Inf[ %name%, there are %count% apples
    {% endtranschoice %}

.. _translation-filters:

The ``trans`` and ``transchoice`` filters can be used to translate *variable
texts* and complex expressions:

.. code-block:: twig

    {{ message|trans }}

    {{ message|transchoice(5) }}

    {{ message|trans({'%name%': 'Fabien'}, "app") }}

    {{ message|transchoice(5, {'%name%': 'Fabien'}, 'app') }}

.. tip::

    Using the translation tags or filters have the same effect, but with
    one subtle difference: automatic output escaping is only applied to
    translations using a filter. In other words, if you need to be sure
    that your translated message is *not* output escaped, you must apply
    the ``raw`` filter after the translation filter:

    .. code-block:: twig

            {# text translated between tags is never escaped #}
            {% trans %}
                <h3>foo</h3>
            {% endtrans %}

            {% set message = '<h3>foo</h3>' %}

            {# strings and variables translated via a filter are escaped by default #}
            {{ message|trans|raw }}
            {{ '<h3>bar</h3>'|trans|raw }}

.. tip::

    You can set the translation domain for an entire Twig template with a single tag:

    .. code-block:: twig

           {% trans_default_domain "app" %}

    Note that this only influences the current template, not any "included"
    template (in order to avoid side effects).

PHP Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The translator service is accessible in PHP templates through the
``translator`` helper:

.. code-block:: html+php

    <?php echo $view['translator']->trans('Symfony is great') ?>

    <?php echo $view['translator']->transChoice(
        '{0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf[ There are %count% apples',
        10,
        array('%count%' => 10)
    ) ?>

.. _translation-resource-locations:

Translation Resource/File Names and Locations
---------------------------------------------

Symfony looks for message files (i.e. translations) in the following locations:

* the ``app/Resources/translations`` directory;

* the ``app/Resources/<bundle name>/translations`` directory;

* the ``Resources/translations/`` directory inside of any bundle.

The locations are listed here with the highest priority first. That is, you can
override the translation messages of a bundle in any of the top 2 directories.

The override mechanism works at a key level: only the overridden keys need
to be listed in a higher priority message file. When a key is not found
in a message file, the translator will automatically fall back to the lower
priority message files.

The filename of the translation files is also important: each message file
must be named according to the following path: ``domain.locale.loader``:

* **domain**: An optional way to organize messages into groups (e.g. ``admin``,
  ``navigation`` or the default ``messages``) - see :ref:`using-message-domains`;

* **locale**: The locale that the translations are for (e.g. ``en_GB``, ``en``, etc);

* **loader**: How Symfony should load and parse the file (e.g. ``xlf``,
  ``php``, ``yml``, etc).

The loader can be the name of any registered loader. By default, Symfony
provides many loaders, including:

* ``xlf``: XLIFF file;
* ``php``: PHP file;
* ``yml``: YAML file.

The choice of which loader to use is entirely up to you and is a matter of
taste. The recommended option is to use ``xlf`` for translations.
For more options, see :ref:`component-translator-message-catalogs`.

.. note::

    You can also store translations in a database, or any other storage by
    providing a custom class implementing the
    :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Translation\\Loader\\LoaderInterface` interface.
    See the :ref:`dic-tags-translation-loader` tag for more information.

.. caution::

    Each time you create a *new* translation resource (or install a bundle
    that includes a translation resource), be sure to clear your cache so
    that Symfony can discover the new translation resources:

    .. code-block:: terminal

        $ php app/console cache:clear

.. _translation-fallback:

Fallback Translation Locales
----------------------------

Imagine that the user's locale is ``fr_FR`` and that you're translating the
key ``Symfony is great``. To find the French translation, Symfony actually
checks translation resources for several locales:

#. First, Symfony looks for the translation in a ``fr_FR`` translation resource
   (e.g. ``messages.fr_FR.xlf``);

#. If it wasn't found, Symfony looks for the translation in a ``fr`` translation
   resource (e.g. ``messages.fr.xlf``);

#. If the translation still isn't found, Symfony uses the ``fallbacks`` configuration
   parameter, which defaults to ``en`` (see `Configuration`_).

.. versionadded:: 2.6
    The ability to log missing translations was introduced in Symfony 2.6.

.. note::

    When Symfony doesn't find a translation in the given locale, it will 
    add the missing translation to the log file. For details, 
    see :ref:`reference-framework-translator-logging`.

Handling the User's Locale
--------------------------

Translating happens based on the user's locale. Read :doc:`/translation/locale`
to learn more about how to handle it.

Translating Database Content
----------------------------

The translation of database content should be handled by Doctrine through
the `Translatable Extension`_ or the `Translatable Behavior`_ (PHP 5.4+).
For more information, see the documentation for these libraries.

Debugging Translations
----------------------

When you work with many translation messages in different languages, it can
be hard to keep track which translations are missing and which are not used
anymore. Read :doc:`/translation/debug` to find out how to identify these
messages.

Summary
-------

With the Symfony Translation component, creating an internationalized application
no longer needs to be a painful process and boils down to just a few basic
steps:

* Abstract messages in your application by wrapping each in either the
  :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Translation\\Translator::trans` or
  :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Translation\\Translator::transChoice` methods
  (learn about this in :doc:`/components/translation/usage`);

* Translate each message into multiple locales by creating translation message
  files. Symfony discovers and processes each file because its name follows
  a specific convention;

* Manage the user's locale, which is stored on the request, but can also
  be set on the user's session.
