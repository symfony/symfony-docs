Component re-added (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22597)
Time to re-merge this PR?

I'll create a separate PR to fix issue related to issues

Can we move forward with the Lock documentation ?

I wish to improve the documentation to fix https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/22452
and prefere to do it in a separated PR instead of updating this one (because it has already been merged once).

Hello guys. As Symfony 3.4 is released with the lock component... It could be a great idea to merge this PR. The link toward the doc is already available here but is broken: https://github.com/symfony/lock#resources
