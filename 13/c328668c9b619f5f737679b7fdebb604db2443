👍 Tom was one of my English pros at DrupalCon that was reading our style guide and finding mistakes. Woohoo! :)

@weaverryan and @javiereguiluz - It was a pleasure to work on the documentation and thanks for all your help, Ryan!  I'm glad I had a chance to peruse the Symfony docs as an example of documentation done right.  Well done!
