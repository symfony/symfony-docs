@HeahDude re "specific formatting" I've noticed the file uses a mix of `array( ... )` and `[ ... ]`. Which should be used?

When I took Javier's commits the branch ended up being created against `symfony-docs/master`. Can you make it be against the right branch when you merge?

Now we use the new short syntax, since the lowest supported version is 3.4 having PHP 5.5 as minimum.

4.1 was master back then, now we need to merge into 4.2 but we can do it on merge thanks to the CLI tool we use to maintain the docs.
Thanks!

Re the code style comment above which is outstanding: Is there a linter for code examples? An automated formatter?

I imagine we stick to Symfony's code style, but as Phpstorm's Symfony2 preset seems to differ in small ways from the current Symfony format, it would be good to have a definitive formatter to use.

@pbowyer This PR conflicts. Could you try to rebase it and fix the conflict? Thanks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by pbowyer at 2019-04-07T09:17:02Z

@lyrixx Of course. 4.2 is the correct one to rebase onto, I believe?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lyrixx at 2019-04-07T09:23:02Z

Exactly :+1: You need to rebase on top of 4.2 and update the target branch on github
Thanks again

There may be one newline missing:
```
As configured, the following property is used by the marking store::
.. code-block:: php
```
I think there should be a blank line between the two?

Can we merge this please? There are more PRs for Workflow coming to fruition, and if they all get approved/merged at the same time, there will be a number of conflicts...
