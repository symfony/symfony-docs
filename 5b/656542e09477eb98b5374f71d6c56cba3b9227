this should be split into 2 separate PRs:

- the X509 documentation should be merged in 2.3+
- The remote_user doc should be merged only in 2.6+

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the PR should be marked as ``WCM`` as the PR is not yet merged in the code repo for the REMOTE_USER feature

Okay I made PR #3913 for x509 which can be merged in 2.3. Hope this is correct.

I'll leave this as a WIP for now. If the #3913 is merged I'll rewrite the REMOTE_USER part of this PR based on it.

@zefrog I think it's better to remove the X509 part here. #3913 can be merged first. After that, this PR can be rebased on the modifications made on the 2.3 branch.

@xabbuh that's exactly what I meant in my previous comment. X509 doc was some "extra", because I only needed initially to document the remote_user part I added in pr symfony/symfony#10698.

But let's wait for #3913 to be merged, I will rewrite the remote_user part according to the contributing guide. Sorry for all the trouble, it's my first doc PR ;)

@zefrog Never mind. It's great to have new people contributing to the documentation. :)

Do I need to rebase /  modify something before this can be merged since the PR has been accepted?

Thx

Is this PR mergeable now? Completing the pre Authenticated documentation makes sense.

@zefrog Besides my minor comment, I think this is ready to be merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by zefrog at 2014-10-07T14:09:03Z

Thank you for the feedback. It's done now.

@zefrog Yeah, I think it's ready to be merged. :+1:
