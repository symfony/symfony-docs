For your information, 2.6 is still maintained, so it's going to be merged in that branch. However, you don't have to worry about it as we have a nice tool that makes it really easy to patch PRs into other branches.

Hey thank you @WouterJ . So any further PR's should go to 2.6 ?

@harikt Actually that depends on the affected versions. But the general rule is to open a PR for the lowest affected version (higher versions will get the changes when branches are merged up). Currently, supported versions are 2.3, 2.6 and 2.7.

@xabbuh ,

Is there a way to find the supported versions ? So people can understand easily to where the PR need to be initialized ?

Thank you.

@harikt You can have a look at http://symfony.com/roadmap or http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html.
