I like the idea but would not add the Logger in this example, yes it makes sense but complicated the example itself

Hello @OskarStark , thank you for your feedback!

I have 3 propositions:

1. Removing the Logger from the example. This leave us with a try/catch that only return a boolean, it's a bit strange IMHO
2. Keeping the Logger and update the intro message of the [Handling Multiple Services](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/master/service_container.rst#handling-multiple-services) to specify that we want to log any exception that can be triggered when sending the email.
3. Replacing the Logger with an other component, but which one ?

Please use the same example as before, no need for a try catch here, itâ€™s just an example and should not distract by things which are not needed.

Using

// ...

Is fine too, meaning there could be some other code parts around. Thanks

Edit:
You can remove the return type too please

If you have further questions or sth is unclear please feel free to ping me again and I can provide the full example. I am currently on a phone ðŸ“²
