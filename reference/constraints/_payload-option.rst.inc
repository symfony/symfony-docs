payload
~~~~~~~

**type**: ``mixed`` **default**: ``null``

This option can be used to attach arbitrary domain-specific data to a constraint.
The configured payload is not used by the Validator component, but its processing
is completely up to you.

For example, you may want to use
:doc:`several error levels </validation/severity>` to present failed
constraints differently in the front-end depending on the severity of the
error.
