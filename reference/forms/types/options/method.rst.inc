method
~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.3
    The ``method`` option was introduced in Symfony 2.3.

**type**: ``string`` **default**: ``POST``

This option specifies the HTTP method used to submit the form's data. Its
value is rendered as the ``method`` attribute of the ``form`` element and is
used to decide whether to process the form submission in the
``handleRequest()`` method after submission. Possible values are:

* POST
* GET
* PUT
* DELETE
* PATCH

.. note::

    When the method is PUT, PATCH, or DELETE, Symfony will automatically
    render a ``_method`` hidden field in your form. This is used to "fake"
    these HTTP methods, as they're not supported on standard browsers. For
    more information, see :doc:`/cookbook/routing/method_parameters`.

.. note::

    The PATCH method allows submitting partial data. In other words, if the
    submitted form data is missing certain fields, those will be ignored
    and the default values (if any) will be used. With all other HTTP methods,
    if the submitted form data is missing some fields, those fields are set
    to ``null``.
