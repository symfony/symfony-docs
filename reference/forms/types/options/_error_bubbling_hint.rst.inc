.. tip::

    By default the ``error_bubbling`` option is enabled for the
    :doc:`collection Field Type </reference/forms/types/collection>`,
    which passes the errors to the parent form. If you want to attach
    the errors to the locations where they actually occur you have to
    set ``error_bubbling`` to ``false``.
