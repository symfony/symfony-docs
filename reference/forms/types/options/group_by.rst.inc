group_by
~~~~~~~~

**type**: ``array``, ``callable`` or ``string`` **default**: ``null``

You can group the ``<option>`` elements of a ``<select>`` into ``<optgroup>``
by passing a multi-dimensional array to ``choices``. See the
:ref:`Grouping Options <form-choices-simple-grouping>` section about that.

The ``group_by`` option is an alternative way to group choices, which gives you
a bit more flexibility.

Take the following example::

    use Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\ChoiceType;
    // ...

    $builder->add('publishAt', ChoiceType::class, array(
        'choices' => array(
            'now' => new \DateTime('now'),
            'tomorrow' => new \DateTime('+1 day'),
            '1 week' => new \DateTime('+1 week'),
            '1 month' => new \DateTime('+1 month'),
        ),
        'group_by' => function($choiceValue, $key, $value) {
            if ($choiceValue <= new \DateTime('+3 days')) {
                return 'Soon';
            } else {
                return 'Later';
            }
        },
    ));

This groups the dates that are within 3 days into "Soon" and everything else into
a "Later" ``<optgroup>``:

If you return ``null``, the option won't be grouped. You can also pass a string
"property path" that will be called to get the group. See the `choice_label`_ for
details about using a property path.
