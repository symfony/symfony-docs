pattern
~~~~~~~

**type**: ``string`` **default**: ``null``

This adds an HTML5 ``pattern`` attribute to restrict the field input by
a given regular expression.

.. caution::

    The ``pattern`` attribute provides client-side validation for convenience
    purposes only and must not be used as a replacement for reliable
    server-side validation.

.. note::

    When using validation constraints, this option is set automatically
    for some constraints to match the server-side validation.
