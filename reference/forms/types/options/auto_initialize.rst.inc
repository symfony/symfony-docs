auto_initialize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**type**: ``boolean``  **default**: ``true``

An internal option: sets whether the form should be initialized automatically.
For all fields, this option should only be ``true`` for root forms. You won't
need to change this option and probably won't need to worry about it.
