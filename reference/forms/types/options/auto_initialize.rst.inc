``auto_initialize``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**type**: ``boolean``  **default**: ``true``

An internal option: sets whether the form should be initialized automatically.
For all fields, this option should only be ``true`` for root forms. You
will not need to change this option and probably will not need to worry about
it.
