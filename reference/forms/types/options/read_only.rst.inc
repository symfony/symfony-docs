read_only
~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.1
    The ``read_only`` option was changed in 2.1 to not render as ``disabled``
    but as ``readonly`` attribute. Use the `disabled`_ option if you need
    the old behaviour.

**type**: ``Boolean`` **default**: ``false``

If this option is true, the field will be rendered with the ``disabled``
attribute so that the field is not editable.
