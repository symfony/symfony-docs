.. caution::

    The ``read_only`` option has been deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.
    Instead, use the ``attr`` option by setting it to an array with a ``readonly`` key.

read_only
~~~~~~~~~

**type**: ``Boolean`` **default**: ``false``

If this option is true, the field will be rendered with the ``readonly``
attribute so that the field is not editable.
