.. tip::

By default the :doc:`collection Field Type </reference/forms/types/collection>` has enabled  the option ``error_bubbling``
which passes the errors to the parent form. If you want to attach the errors
to the locations where they actually occure you have to set ``error_bubbling``
to ``false``.
