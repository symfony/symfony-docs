The Abstract "field" Type
=========================

The ``field`` form type is not an actual field type you use, but rather
functions as the parent field type for many other fields.

The ``field`` type predefines a couple of options:

.. include:: /reference/forms/types/options/data.rst.inc

.. include:: /reference/forms/types/options/required.rst.inc

.. include:: /reference/forms/types/options/disabled.rst.inc

.. include:: /reference/forms/types/options/trim.rst.inc

.. include:: /reference/forms/types/options/property_path.rst.inc

.. include:: /reference/forms/types/options/attr.rst.inc
