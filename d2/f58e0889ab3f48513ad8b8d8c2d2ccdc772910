Great work :clap: This looks good !

Additionally, perhaps in the "Defining your Own Styles" section, we might talk about the `Symfony\Component\Console\Style\OutputStyle` abstract class, which is a good start and implements `OutputInterface`, allowing to use common methods such as `write`, `writeln`, `isVerbose`, ...
Or is it out-of-scope ?

At least, the example on how to create a custom style should take an output as constructor argument I guess.

@ogizanagi thanks for your thorough review. I'm embarrassed about the amount of silly mistakes I made. Hopefully everything is fixed now.

Regarding the abstract OutputStyle class, I think is a bit out of the scope of this article. Let's see if others agree.

Can we change the label of this to "finished"? Thanks!

We must be careful to merge this into `2.8` were it was introduced. By the way, I think we should mention that.

No, actually it was introduced in Symfony 2.7. Only the API docs do not render them for 2.7.

@xabbuh in fact, it was introduced in 2.7, so I think the branch is OK. However, in 2.8 we made a change: `text()` produces a different output and we introduced a new method called `comment()`. I'll do those changes once this is merged.

@javiereguiluz still you need a versionadded at the top of the article.

Added the `versionadded` directive.
