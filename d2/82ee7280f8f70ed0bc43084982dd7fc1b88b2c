Didn't we just remove deprecated options in the past?

I don't know ... but I guess we need to document deprecated versions and remove them in the first Symfony version which doesn't include them (master/4.0 in this case).

@xabbuh that *does* sound a little bit familiar. But adding the option as deprecated and removing it in 4.0 (like we do with other things) makes sense to me.
