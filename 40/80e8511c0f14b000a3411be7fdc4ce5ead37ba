Several months after that issue, Symfony CLI switched provider to provide signing: https://symfony.com/blog/signed-packages-for-symfony-cli

Are we sure we still need this for macOs?

I'm still facing this issue after every Symfony server version update on macOS. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?

I just re-read that blog post. It only refers to Linux packages. So, macOS is still impacted by this issue.
