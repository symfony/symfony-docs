I think we should add a caution directive here to not pass anything blindly here which may leak security related information (something like what is [done in the class docblock](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Exception/CustomUserMessageAuthenticationException.php#L17-L19)).
