Thanks for the review, should i make it one commit again? Or is it okay like this?

I was wondering if it uses an instance of the exception class. I checked the code and it does, maybe this should be documented? Also, [the order is important](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/42244/files#r675956867).

@kbond So it would be nice to have 2 notices 1 mentioning the exception should extend from `\Exception`? And one note about that the ordering is imported?

> mentioning the exception should extend from \Exception

This isn't what I meant. I meant that the first exception class that passes an `instanceof` is what is used.

I think one notice is sufficient as it is related:

```yaml
framework:
    exceptions:
        Exception:
            log_level: debug
            status_code: 404
        RuntimeException: # this will never be used as \RuntimeException extends \Exception
            log_level: debug
            status_code: 422
```

The fix would be to reverse the above:

```yaml
framework:
    exceptions:
        RuntimeException:
            log_level: debug
            status_code: 422
        Exception:
            log_level: debug
            status_code: 404
```

Hope that makes sense.
