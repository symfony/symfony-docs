@iltar thanks for this contribution. We'll need to change a bit the "tone" (some parts read too informal) but so far contents are very promising. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz sure thing! I'm not too experienced with the language style so I'm firstly making sure the contents is up-to-date so it can be fine-tuned afterwards. This is always the hardest part for me writing documentation.

When writing code, you have codestyle, but when you're writing texts it's almost freestyle ;)

@iltar you are doing great! It's just a matter of minor "cosmetic changes". But for now don't worry about them :smile:

@javiereguiluz is the array shorthand notation preferred or do you want the full notation?

edit - for now I will keep amending so I can see if I make parse errors without too many issues, phpstorm only shows me highlights, no validation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2016-04-01T14:14:49Z

@iltar we still use `array()` in the docs.

*So the PR is merged and the previous comments are addressed. I will open a new PR once I'm done writing some initial docs about the actual feature.*

I think everything code related is fixed in this PR so it's up to the text itself now

@iltar Is this supposed to be merged before #6438 or the other way around?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-04-06T17:06:38Z

@xabbuh it doesn't really matter, one describes the feature, the other makes sure the documentation doesn't trigger deprecations in your code.

We also need to doc the new `controller_argument.value_resolver` tag (https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/master/reference/dic_tags.rst).

@iltar great job - I'm really excited about the possibilities of this feature!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-04-11T17:12:33Z

Ah, I will add it here with some extra information. Any other places I might have missed?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2016-04-11T17:12:43Z

Just a random comment: why defining such a long tag? `controller_argument.value_resolver` Why not something like `controller.argument_resolver` ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-04-11T17:15:29Z

@javiereguiluz about the first part you're probably right, `controller` sounds better for this. About the second part, that would imply your own argument resolver, but that's not the same as a value resolver. I can make a PR to rename the tag to:
 - `controller.value_resolver`
 - `controller.argument_value_resolver`
 - `controller.argument_value`

Any preferences?

Broken build is related to:
```rst
:doc:`/cookbook/controller/argument_value_resolver`
```

This will be solved as soon as #6438 is merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2016-06-11T20:00:09Z

Merged #6438 now. Can you please rebase?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-06-12T10:01:49Z

@WouterJ rebase is done and checks pass now

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2016-06-12T10:19:35Z

Can you please also fix the outstanding comments (both from me and others)? Sorry for not reviewing it before asking you to rebase.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2016-07-04T07:31:28Z

@iltar Is this still a work in progress from your point of view?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-07-04T07:39:42Z

@xabbuh I totally forgot to fix the title! No, this should be finished.

by iltar at 2016-07-04T12:08:38Z

Fixed a merge conflict and the feedback, can you please check it 1 time if everything went fine? I had a small issue inbetween

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2016-07-05T08:44:21Z

üëç still looks good to me
