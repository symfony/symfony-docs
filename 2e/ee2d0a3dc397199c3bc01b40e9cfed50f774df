Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.4, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2.

Cheers!

Thanks for this contribution! If possible, please check if this same error occurs in 5.4 branch, which is the oldest maintained branch that could contain the mistake, and try to rebase this pull request to that branch. Thanks!
