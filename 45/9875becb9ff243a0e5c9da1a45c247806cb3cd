@WouterJ what do you think about this PR considering that there are other related PR about normalizing method listings?

Most of these changes are already included in #4539.

@pedronofuentes Can you maybe update your pull request to include the missing changes from this one?

Ok

@pedronofuentes Thank you and sorry for the additional work.

@pedronofuentes Did you manage to include the missing changes into #4539 or should we do a rebase here to get the rest merged?

@xabbuh I'm sorry, I couldn't. Can I help somehow?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@pedronofuentes Don't worry. :) We can still merge this one.

@ternel Are you able to rebase your pull request?
