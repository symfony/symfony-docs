@pueppiblue thanks a lot for this contribution. I totally agree with the addition of the missing `host` option. Thanks for that!

However, I've reverted the other changes mainly for two reasons:

* To not duplicate the explanation about env vars of the `/configuration/external_parameters.rst` article that you linked here.
* Because it's not that simple to do now that Symfony promotes the use of database DSNs in the `DATABASE_URL` env var. We no longer have individual env vars for database name, host, use, etc.

In any case, thanks for your contribution and we've merged it in 3.4 (later we'll merge it in the other branches). Congrats on your Symfony Docs contribution!
