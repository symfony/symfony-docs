The Symfony2 configuration can be done in PHP, YAML, or PHP.

The configuration format used is defined in the HelloKernel.php file -- look
at the bottom of the file (YAML is the default). After you chose the format
that fits you better, you can cleanup this directory by safely removing the
configuration files for the other formats.
