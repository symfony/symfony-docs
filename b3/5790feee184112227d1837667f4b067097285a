Thanks Bernhard. I left some small comments, but overall I think this is a great document to help people contributing. :+1:

Looks like a good step towards reducing the work for core developers and providing a breeding ground for new core developers!

Thanks for the feedback! I updated the PR now.

There's one little `TODO` line floating in there that needs to be removed. But :+1: from me. @webmozart if you're ready for this to be merged - just say so, I can easily remove that TODO line for you.

@webmozart could you finish this one ? It would be great to have this merged and a blog post published so that the experiment could start for real

I just added the test instructions. It wasn't much after all. If everything is fine by you, this is ready to merge.

This might be a useful resource, also for a more generic guide for contributing patches: http://hoa-project.net/En/Literature/Contributor/Guide.html#Testing_a_patch
