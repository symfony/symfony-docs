In the past, the special RST scopes were used because the tool used to merge PRs may use them to extract the information about deciders/mergers and decide if a PR could be merged. However, that tool hardcodes this information in its source code, so this information is no longer needed in this page and I think it's OK to remove it. So :+1: and thanks you for this improvement.

Ah, I didn't know that. Thanks for clarifying the initial reasons for this.

This sounds good. :)
