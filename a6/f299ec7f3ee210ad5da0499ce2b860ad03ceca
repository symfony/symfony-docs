@javiereguiluz I have the same question here as #8538

> On Symfony.com, we would need to remove the "Assetic", "Expressions" and "Request" guides

Will that be automatic?

It's not automatic, but I've removed them in symfony.com repo, so they'll disappear after the next deployment. This is how it'd look:

Thank you @javiereguiluz! It sounds like we should wait until that deploy, correct?
