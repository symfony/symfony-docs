@xabbuh please let me know if this is OK.

This should definitely be merged as the current situation is misleading.

Is there a PR on the Symfony project itself? The default `config.yml` file has the following code:

```yaml
templating:
        engines: ['twig']
        #assets_version: SomeVersionScheme
```

But uncommenting `assets_version` just generates an error.

There is a pull request: symfony/symfony-standard#891

I removed the `base_urls` examples with protocol-relative URLs. Do we want to keep this and rephrase it?

Looks really great to me. Actually the only thing that is missing no is the description of the `base_path` option.

Thank you @xabbuh. Do we want to add the description for `base_path` in this PR or separately?

@snoek09 If you happen to find some time to add it, that would be great. Otherwise, I think we can merge this as is and it afterwards in a separate PR.

@xabbuh I've added the `base_path` option. Maybe this option needs some more text explaining it.
