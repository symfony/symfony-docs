:+1: but if I am not mistaken we need to merge this into the `2.7` branch (Symfony 2.3 still uses PSR-0 for autoloading)

Hi, thanks for replying !
To fulfill your recommendation, should I create another PR with that fix based on 2.7 or update this one ?

@nemo- All is fine, I think we man make the rebase when merging your PR.
