Can you please replace it with `\/` (which also fixes the issue, but still allows the `/` character)?

What you think if I write  the regex like that ( I think that is more readable) ?
$wsseRegex = '/UsernameToken Username="([^"]+)",'
                   . ' PasswordDigest="([^"]+)",'
                   . ' Nonce="([a-zA-Z0-9+\/]+={0,2})",'
                   . ' Created="([^"]+)"/';

To be honest, I don't like concatenation for new lines. We can use the `//x` flag, but then we need to replace all spaces with `\s`, which wouldn't help anything with readability.

For now, let's just change it to `\/`. We can always create a new PR for the line wrapping thing if other maintainers are on your side

Ok. Thank'you.
