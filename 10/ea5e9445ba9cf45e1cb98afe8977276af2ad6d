Not sure why your class names stats with a `:`:

It may not be the best place to ask that but can't those new serializers be back-ported? Sounds extreme to apply it only to `~3.1` cc @dunglas.

Should I be adding these [.. versionadded::](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/documentation/format.html#new-features-or-behavior-changes) ?

@theofidry I would love to backport these to 2.8 but my understanding is that new features are only added to new version, I am trying to get my project up to date with 3.0 so I can use these

New features are, indeed, only allowed in `master`. The only way to bring new normalizers to old component version is to extract them to a separate (non-core) library or bundle.

However, you can use an old version of Symfony (like 2.8) with only the Serializer Component in 3.1.

@mcfedr yes, can you please add the `.. versionadded:: 3.1` directives? (you may also include only one after the list of normalizers)

Is there anything left for merging this PR @WouterJ @xabbuh?

As far as I can see, no. :+1:

If you think it's interesting I'll split the serializer doc in several files and add details on how to configure the `DateTimeNormalizer` and `DataUriNormalizer` when I'll be less busy. I also need to document the new `@MaxDepth` annotation.
