@ismail1432 I've reviewed your contribution and made some fixes. You may be thinking *"he changed everything I contributed!!"* but I hope you understand why we made those changes:

* Syntax issues: Symfony Docs use a very strict format called reStructuredText. That's why the underline of a heading must be of the same length of the heading, the code blocks that contain PHP don't need a `.. code-block` directive, etc.
* Content issues: the example you took from the blog post was a bit complex (my bad!) so I've simplified the route config to make things easier to understand.
* Missing `.. versionadded` directive: it's needed when we document a new feature so the reader knows when a feature was introduced.

In any case, thanks for your contribution and we hope to get more contributions from you in the future. Thanks!
