:+1: Agreed! Except that we no longer maintain the 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 versions of the documention, so we should merge this into 3.3. We can easily switch that during the merge, so you won't have to do anything :)

@wouterj I know that 3.0 is no longer maintained, but the problem is that SensioLabs offers certification for Symfony 3.0 and when you study for it you need to use the documentation for 3.0. Thus I think 3.0 should still be maintained.

If I understand correctly, SensioLabs offers Symfony 3 certificates. These are about Symfony 3.x, not about 3.0 specifically (some questions can be outdated though). If that's not the case, we should indeed rethink our support process.

(@javiereguiluz please confirm)

I'm going to ask internally about this and I'll come back to comment.

Hi guys,

The certification is on Symfony **3.0** only!

@weaverryan But then we should merge this one too, right?
