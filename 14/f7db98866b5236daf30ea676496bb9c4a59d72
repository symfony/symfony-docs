@javiereguiluz testing all PHP versions supported by your bundle is a must-have IMO (PHP is bad at following semver, so you cannot only test the low and high ones).

Btw, this gives me another recommendation: **always** have a job for the lowest PHP minor version you support. If you cannot have CI for it, you must remove it from your composer.json instead (so that Composer installs an older tested release instead of thinking the new untested release is fine).

Thank you for all the feedback. I've made some updates accordingly.

I will test this travis.yaml file in a `php-http/client-common` to see the changes "in the wild"

I've made some updates, I need to check if this works properly.

Does it look good at least?

@Nyholm I'd love to merge this nice addition soon. I know the review process of this PR has been exhausting ... but we'd need a final effort to finish it. Thank you!
