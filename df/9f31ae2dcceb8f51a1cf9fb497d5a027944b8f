Master is 2.6 now, this should be merged into 2.5

Hm, I thought that I opened it against the 2.5 branch.

At least, it was based off the 2.5 branch.

Hey @xabbuh!

Thank you very very much for doing this. But the PR looks like it may be out of date - I'm conflicting when I try to patch into 2.5. If this *is* against 2.5, then that's great - but can you rebase it to the latest 2.5 and let me know?

Thanks!

@weaverryan Thanks for the feedback. I just rebased against the most recent 2.5. Can you check if it now merges nicely?

Ah, @xabbuh can you try one more time? This PR is showing extra, unrelated changes and it's still not patching nicely. It could have been because I was in the middle of merging other things when you did this. I'm all done for now, all branches are merged into each other and pushed.

Sorry and thanks!

There you go. No need apologise. I really appreciate your work for the docs. :)
