Here we can see that it was deprecated: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/08a83a65f5c500a648c12faa2fa03122ee380c8b/CHANGELOG.md#400-beta0-2020-11-27

> the disableHostCheck and allowedHosts options were removed in favor of the firewall option

And here we updated Symfony Docs with changes similar to this one: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/14895/files

So, let's merge this.

Thanks Marc!
