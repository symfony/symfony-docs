Are you sure that you can simply replace `setCurrent()` with `setProgress()`? I tried that in the Symfony Installer, but then got no progress bar output at all.

@xabbuh I didn't try the code myself. I only read the new code:

`getStep()` just calls `getProgress()`

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.7/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Helper/ProgressBar.php#L171-181

`setCurrent()` just calls `setProgress()`

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.7/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Helper/ProgressBar.php#L358-370

@javiereguiluz That's what I thought too. I will try it again with the installer tonight.

@javiereguiluz I just checked again changing the Symfony Installer code. Can you please try out https://github.com/xabbuh/symfony-installer/tree/progress-bar-methods? The only difference to the `master` branch is the usage of `setProgress()` instead of `setCurrent()`.

@xabbuh I've tested your code and it works for me. I can see the same progress bar and the same behavior as before.

@javiereguiluz Hm, this is a bit weird, but probably just related to my system. Tested it on another computer where it works as expected. So, I think this is good to be merged. Thank you (especially for testing!).
