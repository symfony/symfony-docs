@Vehsamrak technically AsseticBundle is not "deprecated" but "not officially included". Anyway, I agree with your proposal 👍

👍 At least, this now matches the kernel from the Standard Edition. I also suggest that we merge this into the `2.8` branch where the bundle was removed from the Symfony Standard Edition.
