I got even bolder with this PR. I removed the "user" stuff because it is invalid.

@nicolas-grekas Could you verify the correctness of these docs?

We could need more details about the supported DSN for multi-hosts, but this is a very good start, thanks!

I've updated the PR to show some more examples with options.

I think it makes sense to show off how to configure the DSN since this will also be used with the framework bundle. If you are using the stand alone component you are more likely to pass an array of options as the second argument of `createConnection`.

Thank you for the reviews. I promise that I will make at least one PR without any syntax errors this month.

No worries, that's teamwork: round-robin errors and fixes ;)
