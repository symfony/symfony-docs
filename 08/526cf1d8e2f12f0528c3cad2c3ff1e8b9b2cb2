I think we should merge this in 3.4, because `config/bootstrap.php` was created in 3.3. See https://github.com/symfony/recipes/tree/master/symfony/framework-bundle/3.3/config  @OskarStark @xabbuh what do you think? Thanks.

That's tricky because our setup guidelines don't make use of Flex so you won't get this file without doing so explicitly, right?

@xabbuh yes, I use Flex and it's new project.

@xabbuh do you have any questions? Is it ready to be merged or I have to change something?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I still think that this does not really fit the 3.4 docs if people following the setup guide not using Flex will run into errors when following this change (because they do not have the `bootstrap.php` file).

@xabbuh I did a PR in 4.3, not in 3.4.

Yes, but Javier asked whether we should merge into the `3.4` branch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by gregurco at 2019-07-15T21:30:31Z

I think it's not related to 3.4. I also started project with 3.4 and I didn't remember such a problem there.

If 3.4 is OK, then we'll merge in 4.2 Thanks.

@javiereguiluz right now I created new Symfony 3.4 project and in phpunit.xml.dist I found:
```
bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"
```

So, it's not relevant for SF 3.4. Changes can be merged.
