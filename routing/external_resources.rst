How to Include External Routing Resources
=========================================

Simple applications can define all their routes in a single configuration file -
usually ``config/routes.yaml`` (see :ref:`routing-creating-routes`).
However, in most applications it's common to import routes definitions from
different resources: PHP annotations in controller files, YAML or XML files
stored in some directory, etc.

This can be done by importing routing resources from the main routing file:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/routes.yaml
        app_file:
            # loads routes from the given routing file stored in some bundle
            resource: '@AcmeOtherBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml'

        app_annotations:
            # loads routes from the PHP annotations of the controllers found in that directory
            resource: '../src/Controller/'
            type:     annotation

        app_directory:
            # loads routes from the YAML or XML files found in that directory
            resource: '../legacy/routing/'
            type:     directory

        app_bundle:
            # loads routes from the YAML or XML files found in some bundle directory
            resource: '@AppBundle/Resources/config/routing/public/'
            type:     directory

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/routes.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <routes xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/routing"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/routing
                http://symfony.com/schema/routing/routing-1.0.xsd">

            <!-- loads routes from the given routing file stored in some bundle -->
            <import resource="@AcmeOtherBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml" />

            <!-- loads routes from the PHP annotations of the controllers found in that directory -->
            <import resource="../src/Controller/" type="annotation" />

            <!-- loads routes from the YAML or XML files found in that directory -->
            <import resource="../legacy/routing/" type="directory" />

            <!-- loads routes from the YAML or XML files found in some bundle directory -->
            <import resource="@AppBundle/Resources/config/routing/public/" type="directory" />
        </routes>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/routes.php
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection;

        $collection = new RouteCollection();
        $collection->addCollection(
            // loads routes from the given routing file stored in some bundle
            $loader->import("@AcmeOtherBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml")

            // loads routes from the PHP annotations of the controllers found in that directory
            $loader->import("../src/Controller/", "annotation")

            // loads routes from the YAML or XML files found in that directory
            $loader->import("../legacy/routing/", "directory")

            // loads routes from the YAML or XML files found in some bundle directory
            $loader->import("@AppBundle/Resources/config/routing/public/", "directory")
        );

        return $collection;

.. note::

    When importing resources from YAML, the key (e.g. ``app_file``) is meaningless.
    Just be sure that it's unique so no other lines override it.

Prefixing Imported Routes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also choose to provide a "prefix" for the imported routes. For example,
suppose you want to prefix all application routes with ``/site`` (e.g.
``/site/blog/{slug}`` instead of ``/blog/{slug}``):

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/routes.yaml
        controllers:
            resource: '../src/Controller/'
            type:     annotation
            prefix:   /site

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/routes.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <routes xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/routing"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/routing
                http://symfony.com/schema/routing/routing-1.0.xsd">

            <import
                resource="../src/Controller/"
                type="annotation"
                prefix="/site" />
        </routes>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/routes.php
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection;

        $app = $loader->import('../src/Controller/', 'annotation');
        $app->addPrefix('/site');

        $collection = new RouteCollection();
        $collection->addCollection($app);

        return $collection;

The path of each route being loaded from the new routing resource will now
be prefixed with the string ``/site``.

Adding a Host Requirement to Imported Routes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set the host regex on imported routes. For more information, see
:ref:`component-routing-host-imported`.
