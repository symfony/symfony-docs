How to Visualize And Debug Routes
=================================

While adding and customizing routes, it's helpful to be able to visualize
and get detailed information about your routes. A great way to see every
route in your application is via the ``debug:router`` console command. Execute
the command by running the following from the root of your project.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console debug:router

This command will print a helpful list of *all* the configured routes in
your application:

.. code-block:: text

    homepage              ANY       /
    contact               GET       /contact
    contact_process       POST      /contact
    article_show          ANY       /articles/{_locale}/{year}/{title}.{_format}
    blog                  ANY       /blog/{page}
    blog_show             ANY       /blog/{slug}

You can also get very specific information on a single route by including
the route name after the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console debug:router article_show

Likewise, if you want to test whether a URL matches a given route, you can
use the ``router:match`` console command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console router:match /blog/my-latest-post

This command will print which route the URL matches.

.. code-block:: text

    Route "blog_show" matches
