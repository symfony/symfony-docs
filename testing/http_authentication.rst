How to Simulate HTTP Authentication in a Functional Test
========================================================

.. caution::

    Starting from Symfony 5.1, a ``loginUser()`` method was introduced to
    ease testing secured applications. See :ref:`testing_logging_in_users`
    for more information about this.

    If you are still using an older version of Symfony, view
    `previous versions of this article`_ for information on how to simulate
    HTTP authentication.
