Will ``@symfony/mergers`` and ``@symfony/deciders`` then be somehow visible on GitHub later on?

@xabbuh AFAIK, teams are only visible for their members on github. I don't think there is a way to mark a team as public.

@stof I see. But, does it then have any value to add this information?

yeah, because you can ping teams on github

E.g. `ping @symfony/team-symfony-docs` will ping ryan, fabian and me.

Alright, the issue is that this behaviour is not really obvious since you can't check if such a team does exist when you are not a member of it. Maybe it's better to add a short explanation for that.
