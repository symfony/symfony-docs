Can you change that also in the XML and PHP example? By the way, this should be merged into the 2.3 branch. Don't know if @weaverryan can cerry pick this commit or if it was better open a new pull request against the right branch.

I can patch to a different branch as long as it patches cleanly - so we can assume it's not a problem - thanks @xabbuh :)
