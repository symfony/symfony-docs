Are you using ORM and ODM in the same project?

No I'm not. It's there specific dimension for event listeners when using the ODM?

I am not quite sure, I thought that `doctrine.*` is always an alias for the configured one, in your case `doctrine_mongodb.odm.*`

maybe @alcaeus can help us out here, but he is currently on holiday ‚òÄÔ∏è

That‚Äôs a üëé from me: the tutorial covers using Doctrine ORM. The MongoDB ODM docs are found elsewhere: https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineMongoDBBundle/index.html

If anything at all, the main documentation page should mention that the guide covers ORM and maybe link to the ODM docs, but nothing else. If you‚Äôre adding ODM documentation there, you‚Äôll have to add it to other parts (e.g. query builders, mapping, etc. as well which would definitely go too far IMO).

I agree with @alcaeus here.
