üëç Looks indeed like this is missing. Maybe we can remove the command output, I don't think it's very usefull and it'll be outdated as soon as we add new branches (and takes much space). This can be done while merging, but feel free to update this PR if you have time.

removed the command output and squashed my history down so all my changes are in a single commit.

@chancegarcia looks like something went wrong with squashing (seems like you squashed on master or so). can you please rebase against 2.7?

```
$ git rebase --onto origin/2.7 origin/master
```

ran  `$  git rebase --onto origin/2.7 origin/master` then force updated by branch.
