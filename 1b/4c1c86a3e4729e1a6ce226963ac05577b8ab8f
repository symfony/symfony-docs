@WouterJ thanks for your exhaustive review. Awesome work as always!

Regarding the contents of this tutorial, I'd like to add two things:

  * The technical part of this article should be correct because it has been written by Heroku and validated by independent companies, such as SensioLabs.
  * Most of the contents have been borrowed from [the original tutorial published by Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-symfony2) but we've been legally entitled to do so.
