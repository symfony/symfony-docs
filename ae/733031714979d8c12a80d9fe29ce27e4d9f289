Thank you for writing the docs, @iltar! It's looking great. I'm afraid I've decorated your PR a bit with some comments, but they are mostly minor style comments.

@fabpot in the example I'm writing the `UserValueResolver` which I've based on the PR in the SensioFrameworkExtraBundle. While we're at the subject, should I add this code to a PR for 3.1, wait for 3.2 or is this something specific enough that people should implement them self?

I think it makes sense to add this feature directly in Symfony... that's one reason we made things more flexible. Submit this to master, that could be merged into 3.1 or 3.2.

Anything left to fix in this PR?

@HeahDude I've rewritten it a bit with an example, I'm hoping this is easier to understand

Any last checks? I'd say this is ready to be merged :smile:
