@cordoval you can find about how to improve it's results/contribute in it's [repository](https://github.com/mitom/symfony-doc-bot)

About how to use it, well typing `!sf` in #symfony would get you this very [helpful message](https://github.com/mitom/symfony-doc-bot/blob/master/cloudbot/symfony.py#L8)

@WouterJ you should probably check other sidebars as well to verify they have an anchor

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@stof I believe almost none has one. However, most sidebars contain "side information". This one contains actually really important information, so I decided to add it (well, @mitom told me to do it :P).

But feel free to add more anchors if you think it'll be used much.
