How to Deploy a Symfony Application
===================================

Deploying a Symfony application can be a complex and varied task depending on
the setup and the requirements of your application. This article is not a step-
by-step guide, but is a general list of the most common requirements and ideas
for deployment.

.. _symfony2-deployment-basics:

Symfony Deployment Basics
-------------------------

The typical steps taken while deploying a Symfony application include:

#. Upload your code to the production server;
#. Install your vendor dependencies (typically done via Composer and may be done
   before uploading);
#. Running database migrations or similar tasks to update any changed data structures;
#. Clearing (and optionally, warming up) your cache.

A deployment may also include other tasks, such as:

* Tagging a particular version of your code as a release in your source control
  repository;
* Creating a temporary staging area to build your updated setup "offline";
* Running any tests available to ensure code and/or server stability;
* Removal of any unnecessary files from the ``web/`` directory to keep your
  production environment clean;
* Clearing of external cache systems (like `Memcached`_ or `Redis`_).

How to Deploy a Symfony Application
-----------------------------------

There are several ways you can deploy a Symfony application. Start with a few
basic deployment strategies and build up from there.

Basic File Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most basic way of deploying an application is copying the files manually
via FTP/SCP (or similar method). This has its disadvantages as you lack control
over the system as the upgrade progresses. This method also requires you
to take some manual steps after transferring the files (see `Common Post-Deployment Tasks`_)

Using Source Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using source control (e.g. Git or SVN), you can simplify by having
your live installation also be a copy of your repository. When you're ready to
upgrade it is as simple as fetching the latest updates from your source control
system. When using Git, a common approach is to create a tag for each release
and check out the appropriate tag on deployment (see `Git Tagging`_).

This makes updating your files *easier*, but you still need to worry about
manually taking other steps (see `Common Post-Deployment Tasks`_).

Using Platforms as a Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The specific deployment steps vary greatly from one service provider to another,
so check out the dedicated article for the service of your choose:

    :glob:

    deployment/*

Using Build Scripts and other Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are also tools to help ease the pain of deployment. Some of them have been
specifically tailored to the requirements of Symfony.

`Capistrano`_ with `Symfony plugin`_
    `Capistrano`_ is a remote server automation and deployment tool written in Ruby.
    `Symfony plugin`_ is a plugin to ease Symfony related tasks, inspired by `Capifony`_
    (which works only with Capistrano 2).

`sf2debpkg`_
    Helps you build a native Debian package for your Symfony project.

`Magallanes`_
    This Capistrano-like deployment tool is built in PHP, and may be easier
    for PHP developers to extend for their needs.

`Fabric`_
    This Python-based library provides a basic suite of operations for executing
    local or remote shell commands and uploading/downloading files.

`Deployer`_
    This is another native PHP rewrite of Capistrano, with some ready recipes for
    Symfony.

`Automate`_
    A deployment tool written in php. Automate is based on a yaml configuration file.

Bundles
    There are some `bundles that add deployment features`_ directly into your
    Symfony console.

Basic scripting
    You can of course use shell, `Ant`_ or any other build tool to script
    the deploying of your project.

Common Post-Deployment Tasks
----------------------------

After deploying your actual source code, there are a number of common things
you'll need to do:

A) Check Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if your server meets the requirements by running:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/symfony_requirements

.. _b-configure-your-app-config-parameters-yml-file:

B) Configure your Parameters File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most Symfony applications define configuration parameters in a file called
``app/config/parameters.yml``. This file should *not* be deployed, because
Symfony generates it automatically using the ``app/config/parameters.yml.dist``
file as a template (that's why ``parameters.yml.dist`` must be committed and
deployed).

If your application uses environment variables instead of these parameters, you
must define those env vars in your production server using the tools provided by
your hosting service.

C) Install/Update your Vendors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your vendors can be updated before transferring your source code (i.e.
update the ``vendor/`` directory, then transfer that with your source
code) or afterwards on the server. Either way, just update your vendors
as you normally do:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

.. tip::

    The ``--optimize-autoloader`` flag improves Composer's autoloader performance
    significantly by building a "class map". The ``--no-dev`` flag ensures that
    development packages are not installed in the production environment.

.. caution::

    If you get a "class not found" error during this step, you may need to
    run ``export SYMFONY_ENV=prod`` before running this command so that
    the ``post-install-cmd`` scripts run in the ``prod`` environment.

D) Clear your Symfony Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you clear and warm-up your Symfony cache:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod --no-debug --no-warmup
    $ php bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod

E) Dump your Assetic Assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using Assetic, you'll also want to dump your assets:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console assetic:dump --env=prod --no-debug

F) Other Things!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There may be lots of other things that you need to do, depending on your
setup:

* Running any database migrations
* Clearing your APC cache
* Running ``assets:install`` (already taken care of in ``composer install``)
* Add/edit CRON jobs
* Pushing assets to a CDN
* ...

Application Lifecycle: Continuous Integration, QA, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------

While this entry covers the technical details of deploying, the full lifecycle
of taking code from development up to production may have more steps:
deploying to staging, QA (Quality Assurance), running tests, etc.

The use of staging, testing, QA, continuous integration, database migrations
and the capability to roll back in case of failure are all strongly advised. There
are simple and more complex tools and one can make the deployment as easy
(or sophisticated) as your environment requires.

Don't forget that deploying your application also involves updating any dependency
(typically via Composer), migrating your database, clearing your cache and
other potential things like pushing assets to a CDN (see `Common Post-Deployment Tasks`_).
