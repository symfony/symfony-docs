Does it make sense to remove the reference to the JMS serializer?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@xabbuh if the reference is not removed, it should be reworded. Circular references and groups was the main gap between JMS and Symfony Serializer. Since it's filled, I'm not sure there is a reason to recommend another solution than the built-in one (JMS = more dependancies to the project, a different release and BC policy, licenses issues etc).

Or maybe something like "A popular alternative to the Symfony Serializer is JMSSerializer"?

@dunglas Rewording and short it sounds like a good idea to me. We can then also set it in a `seealso` block.
