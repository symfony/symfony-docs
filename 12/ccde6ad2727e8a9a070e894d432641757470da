@richardudovich if I'm right, this is your first contribution to Symfony docs. Therefore, thank you for helping us improve the doc :)

@xabbuh is one of the Symfony doc managers and made two comments about your pull request. As you can see, you should only remove two blank lines and add one word. After those changes, your pull request will be ready to be merged.

If you have any trouble making these changes or if you have any other question/doubt about the contribution process, please ask us. We're here to help you. Thanks!

Thanks for getting back to me. I actually wasn't sure that I was suppose to
do something sorry.
In any case I have removed the two lines, but i am not sure about what word
i should add...

Regards
Richard

@richard sorry for not explaining myself properly. In the line 283 of the `book/service_container.rst` file you have the following:

```
[...] Read on to learn about both methods.
```

However, @xabbuh proposes you to slightly change it by the following:

```
[...] Read on to learn more about both methods.
```

Thank you for your great work @richardudovich. This reads very well to me. Please apologise if my comments where not clear enough. I sadly didn't recognize that you didn't contribute to the docs before.

Our native speaker @weaverryan will have a look at the and proofread them (and hopefully just merge them :)).
