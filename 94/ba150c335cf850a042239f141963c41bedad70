`TransformationFailedException`  should be used when transformation failed. Data mappers shouldn't transform data, DataTransformers should. DataMappers should only map (the transformed) data to the subject (entity, DTO, array, etc).

So üëç for documenting this feature, but please add it to the DataTransformer article to not advocate wrong usage

Wouter, thanks for the review ... I've reverted the changes to explain this in the data transformers article.

@javiereguiluz Could you reword the commit message to talk about data transformers instead of data mappers? Might be less confusing for some future reader of the git history. :)

Ah, maybe that's not necessary. I edited the PR title and during merge we will squash anyway (which should take the PR title as the commit message if I am not mistaken)
