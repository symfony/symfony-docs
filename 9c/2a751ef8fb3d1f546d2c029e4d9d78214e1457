Thanks, this closes #6524.

<strike>Missing documentation for `Parse(.. $references)`</strike> not part of the pulic API.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also `2.5` introduced the `$objectForMap` argument to parse

I like this one, it's straight to the point and clear. Thanks!

Updated. As noted above 2.5 introduced a new argument. Shall I wait until this is resolved / merged before making a PR on 2.5, and then finally on 3.1 ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@dantleech 2.5 is not maintained anymore, so I suggest you wait for this to be merged on 2.7 to send another PR.

You will need to add a note version added where you can point 2.5.

@dantleech you can already create a PR for 2.7 and then rebase after this PR is merged. That allows us to review things already so merging will be a quick process.

Updated.

Just left some last minor comments, but overall this looks quite great!

I just noticed that the chapter contains this sentence:

> Of course, the Symfony Yaml dumper is not able to dump resources. Also, even if the dumper is able to dump PHP objects, it is considered to be a not supported feature.

What do we do with it? Remove it?

> What do we do with it? Remove it?

Hmm. Either we remove that or the new documentation, or we add a warning.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2016-05-21T13:43:24Z

My suggestion: Let's remove the existing one and add a warning in the new section telling people that object support is a feature only existing in the Symfony Yaml component and thus (as not being part of the standard) very likely not supported in other implementations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@xabbuh I'd say remove it. The code display show a clear warning when trying to dump resources, so the docs can safely ignore this edge case.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by dantleech at 2016-05-21T14:07:19Z

Removed the previous `note::` and added a `warning::` ..
