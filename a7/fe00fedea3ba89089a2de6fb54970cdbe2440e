@xabbuh why 2.4? I saw this error while reading the 2.5 branch.

@pmartelletti This error was introduced when the 2.3 branch was merged into the 2.4 branch (you can see that [here](http://symfony.com/doc/2.4/cookbook/security/voters.html#creating-a-custom-voter) too). But there's nothing you have to do. @weaverryan can easily pick this command and merge it into the 2.4 branch. Once it has been merged into the 2.4 branch, it should get into 2.5 when 2.4 is merged into 2.5.
