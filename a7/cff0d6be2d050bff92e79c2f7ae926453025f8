@WouterJ Though I am not sure if this can merged as is due to the changes to the `conf.py` file.

@javiereguiluz What do you think?

I think this is great! Thanks @xabbuh

@javiereguiluz I mean, will this work with the current config of the build server? Or do we need to wait for an update of the config before being able to merge this?

I've just created a pull request in the private Sphinx parser to replicate the changes you made on this PR. I think Fabien will merge them soon and then, the server will be ready to process these changes.

@WouterJ yes, it was merged on Saturday morning, so things should be ready by now.
