@javiereguiluz Thanks for your comments. I simply replaced *suffix* by *prefix*. But it's really a good idea to be more precise. I updated the pull request. I chose to use "binary-prefixed unit". What do you think?

I like "suffix", since the user will use this as the suffix for their value and the message will show them some number, suffixed by a string (e.g. `5 mb`).

@xabbuh thanks for updating the PR. I really like it now!

So, should we revert the change to the ``versionadded`` directive and the table, but keep the changes in the rest?

IMHO yes. What do you think @weaverryan, @javiereguiluz  ?

@xabbuh revert the `versionadded` and one entry below it. I've added some comments to hopefully make it clear.

Thanks!

@jeremy-derusse @weaverryan Thanks for the feedback. Updated.

I don't see why you like "suffix". That is just the display position and nothing semantical. Also some languages might display units in front, like `â‚¬ 5,--`. Would you still call it a suffix?

@Tobion you are right in the sense that "prefix" is the most correct term in this case. But as @weaverryan said, for the user this is always a suffix:

We also use the word "suffix" in the properties `maxsizemessage` and `uploadinisizeerrormessage`
