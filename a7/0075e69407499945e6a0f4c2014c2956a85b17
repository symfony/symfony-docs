@HeahDude it should be 3.1, this functionality was already removed in 3.0 thus makes no sense to keep it in 3.1 but remove it in 3.2 (or am I missing something?)

@iltar 3.1 reached end-of-maintenance by the end of January. That's the time we stopped merging PRs into the `3.1` branch in the docs too.

> Symfony 3.1 is a stable release whose support will end in July 2017
