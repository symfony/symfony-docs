Good catch @carlosreig. However, I think we should do better than hardcoding paths in the `vendor` directory.

What about using reflection here to determine the path to the `TwigEngine` class which reside in the top level directory of the TwigBridge?

Cool! Good idea. I will work on it.

Changed the hardcoded path by a ReflectionClass of the AppVariable class located in the TwigBridge library.
Used AppVariable instead of TwigEngine because TwigEngine has dependencies on the Templating component that is not needed if using the Form component outside Symfony framework.

Done! The spaces around the parameter are removed.
