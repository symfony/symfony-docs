@aferrandini this should be applied to Sf 2.6 instead of 2.5, shouldn't it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2014-07-05T14:56:38Z

@aferrandini in the ` book/security.rst` file, I would only explain the new method to encode passwords. If you want, you can add a note or sidebar explaining how to get the encoder for a given user, just in case the developer needs to do some advanced stuff. But for regular developers, in my opinion the new method is the only thing that they should use.

By the way, you should add a ``versionadded`` directive explaining that the new service was introduced in Symfon 2.6.

Updated with modifications proposed by @javiereguiluz and @xabbuh.

- Changed the version which applies to 2.6.
- Changed the default way to encode a password.
- Added a sidebar to explain who to get the encoder for some advanced staff.
- Changed the title to "Validating a plaintext password".

@aferrandini thanks for completing this doc. I'm :+1: with it, except for the possible tweaks suggested by native English speakers such as @weaverryan.

I think we can also simplify `custom_password_authenticator.rst` a little bit too I think! @aferrandini can you make that update?

This is awesome!

@weaverryan just moved `Validating a Plaintext Password` to `book\security.rst`.

I'm not sure if this section should go before `Retrieving the User Object` section.

Please check it and tell me if I have to move it.

@aferrandini can you also update `cookbook/security/custom_password_authenticator.rst`? It uses the encoder factory and then uses the `isPasswordValid` method. I think we can now just inject your new service into `TimeAuthenticator` and use it directly. Much easier :).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aferrandini at 2014-08-07T00:22:32Z

👍

I'm on vacation without laptop because of the family and my girlfriend. I'll be back on Monday and I'll try yo change it.

Hi all, I've been a little disconnected due to a issue in my body ;P

@weaverryan I changed the `custom_password_authenticator.rst` and the service injection.

Please check it ;)

(if you've time left, can you please squash the commits?)

@WouterJ squashed. ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aferrandini at 2014-08-26T11:06:13Z

@xabbuh fixed the double backticks.

What do you think about declare the var `$plainPassword = 'ryanpass';` in a new line and leave it as it is.
