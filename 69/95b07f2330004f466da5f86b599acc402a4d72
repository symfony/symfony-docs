@xabbuh thanks for working on this!

I have a comment about the new table syntax. In [this table](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4435/files#diff-bb96593a7a270f89d21571e736b4861eR42), columns are separated with two white spaces, while in the rest of the tables you use one white space.

Instead of suggesting you to use also one white space on the first table, I'd like to ask you reconsider using always two white spaces. That's what I've been using and I think that it improves readability.

@javiereguiluz There was no specific reason. Honestly, I simply didn't realise that there already were two spaces. Personally, I don't really care if we use one space or two spaces.

@WouterJ @weaverryan What are your thoughts on this?

+1 for 2 spaces

If both render ok, I'm also cool with 2 spaces - I guess the extra separation makes it a bit more readable in the source.

Alright, do we wanna do that in this pull request or do you prefer a different one?

@xabbuh This one if it's ok - it'll save me from merging up twice, which may involve a few conflicts :).

Of course, no problem. Here we go.
