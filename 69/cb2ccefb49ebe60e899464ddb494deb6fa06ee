Won't this also redirect `/form/foo.html` to `/forms/foo.html`?

@javiereguiluz I think you implemented the redirection logic. Can you please check this?

@xabbuh no, that won't happen. The exception listener takes the contents of https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/master/_build/redirection_map and treats each entry as a separate URL, so only `/form` would be redirected to `/forms` and the rest of form articles will remain unaffected.
