/**
 * Class for scanning a directory for files/directories that match a certain
 * criteria.
 *
 * These criteria consist of a set of include and exclude patterns. With these
 * patterns, you can select which files you want to have included, and which
 * files you want to have excluded.
 *
 * The idea is simple. A given directory is recursively scanned for all files
 * and directories. Each file/directory is matched against a set of include
 * and exclude patterns. Only files/directories that match at least one
 * pattern of the include pattern list, and don't match a pattern of the
 * exclude pattern list will be placed in the list of files/directories found.
 *
 * When no list of include patterns is supplied, "**" will be used, which
 * means that everything will be matched. When no list of exclude patterns is
 * supplied, an empty list is used, such that nothing will be excluded.
 *
 * The pattern matching is done as follows:
 * The name to be matched is split up in path segments. A path segment is the
 * name of a directory or file, which is bounded by DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR
 * ('/' under UNIX, '\' under Windows).
 * E.g. "abc/def/ghi/xyz.php" is split up in the segments "abc", "def", "ghi"
 * and "xyz.php".
 * The same is done for the pattern against which should be matched.
 *
 * Then the segments of the name and the pattern will be matched against each
 * other. When '**' is used for a path segment in the pattern, then it matches
 * zero or more path segments of the name.
 *
 * There are special case regarding the use of DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR at
 * the beginning of the pattern and the string to match:
 * When a pattern starts with a DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, the string
 * to match must also start with a DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.
 * When a pattern does not start with a DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, the
 * string to match may not start with a DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.
 * When one of these rules is not obeyed, the string will not
 * match.
 *
 * When a name path segment is matched against a pattern path segment, the
 * following special characters can be used:
 *   '*' matches zero or more characters,
 *   '?' matches one character.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * "**\*.php" matches all .php files/dirs in a directory tree.
 *
 * "test\a??.php" matches all files/dirs which start with an 'a', then two
 * more characters and then ".php", in a directory called test.
 *
 * "**" matches everything in a directory tree.
 *
 * "**\test\**\XYZ*" matches all files/dirs that start with "XYZ" and where
 * there is a parent directory called test (e.g. "abc\test\def\ghi\XYZ123").
 *
 * Case sensitivity may be turned off if necessary.  By default, it is
 * turned on.
 *
 * Example of usage:
 *   $ds = new DirectroyScanner();
 *   $includes = array("**\*.php");
 *   $excludes = array("modules\*\**");
 *   $ds->SetIncludes($includes);
 *   $ds->SetExcludes($excludes);
 *   $ds->SetBasedir("test");
 *   $ds->SetCaseSensitive(true);
 *   $ds->Scan();
 *
 *   print("FILES:");
 *   $files = ds->GetIncludedFiles();
 *   for ($i = 0; $i < count($files);$i++) {
 *     println("$files[$i]\n");
 *   }
 *
 * This will scan a directory called test for .php files, but excludes all
 * .php files in all directories under a directory called "modules"
 *
 * This class is complete preg/ereg free port of the Java class
 * org.apache.tools.ant.DirectoryScanner. Even functions that use preg/ereg
 * internally (like split()) are not used. Only the _fast_ string functions
 * and comparison operators (=== !=== etc) are used for matching and tokenizing.
