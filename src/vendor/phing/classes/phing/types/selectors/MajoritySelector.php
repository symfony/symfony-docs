/**
 * This selector is here just to shake up your thinking a bit. Don't get
 * too caught up in boolean, there are other ways you can evaluate a
 * collection of selectors. This one takes a vote of the selectors it
 * contains, and majority wins. You could also have an "all-but-one"
 * selector, a "weighted-average" selector, and so on. These are left
 * as exercises for the reader (as are the usecases where this would
 * be necessary).
