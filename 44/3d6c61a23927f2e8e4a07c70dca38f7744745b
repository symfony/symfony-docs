Since these features are deprecated in 5.4 and replaced by `DoctrineDbalStore` and `DoctrineDbalPostgreSqlStore`, this PR may target branch 5.4.

Also, the new classes needs to be documented. (related to #15903)

@GromNaN if you think its a good idea to write all documentation in one pull request? There are multiple open issue to write documentation for this see: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/15952 & https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/15950 & https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/15945
