Sorry, but I don't get the capitalization rules :) Not a native speaker, though.

@mpdude we use title caps, which means that every word is capitialized except from closed-class words. Closed-class words are words that can't be "extended" by other words. E.g. "title" is not a closed-class word, you can extend it by saying "a strong title", "a complicated title", etc. "the" on the other hand can't be extended and is a closed-class word.

Extended the section on custom exception listeners that was discussed in #4181 and would like to get @stof's opinion on this.

@mpdude For now, I think it's fine if you just remove the backticks in the headlines completely. We can discuss this topic later on. But that's out of the scope of this pull request. Sorry for the confusion.

Roger that. Let me know when I should squash this PR.

How/when will you decide if this gets merged?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From my point of view, this is perfect to be merged now. Let's see what the others think.

If you want to, you can of course squash your commits.

Great, because I could then work on #4293 for Smyfony 2.6.
