The main PR symfony/symfony#15491 has been merged.

A versionadded directive should also be added directly after the section title:
```rst
.. versionadded:: 2.8
    The `deprecated` setting was introduced in Symfony 2.8.
```

I'm :+1: for merging this PR. The comments can be addressed after the merge, as they are mostly about markup and not content (however, if you have time and want to do it, feel free to do it).
