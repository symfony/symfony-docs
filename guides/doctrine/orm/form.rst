Form Integration
================

There is a tight integration between Doctrine ORM and the Symfony Form component. Since Doctrine Entities
are plain old php objects they nicely integrate into the Form component by default, at least for the
primitive data types such as strings, integers and fields. However you can also integrate them nicely
with associations.

This is done by the help of ValueTransformers, which are form field extension points. There are currently
three transformers that allow you to transform Doctrine ORM Collections and Entities into their identifier
values that can be used with the Form component. Furthermore they translate form values back to the Doctrine
representation in the most efficient way possible, issuing as few queries as possible.

CollectionToChoiceTransformer
-----------------------------

This transformer allows you to transform a Collection of Entities into an array of ids. This transformer
should be used with the ChoiceField or any compatible field that handles arrays of values.

    use Symfony\Component\Form\ChoiceField;
    use Symfony\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\Form\ValueTransformer\CollectionToChoiceTransformer;

    $field = new ChoiceField('products', array(
        'choices' => $productChoices,
        'multiple' => true,
        'expanded' => true,
    ));
    $field->setValueTransformer(new CollectionToChoiceTransformer(array(
        'em' => $em,
        'className' => 'Product',
    )));
    
    // Important: Make sure to attach the value transformer before calling addField().
    $form->addField($field);

The 'em' property expects the EntityManager, the 'className' property expects the Entity Class name
as an argument.

CollectionToStringTransformer
-----------------------------

This transformer allows you to transform a Collection of Entities into a string separated by a separator.
This is useful for lists of tags, usernames or similiar unique fields of your Entities.

EntityToIDTransformer
---------------------

This transformer converts an Entity into its ID and back to allow to select many-to-one
or one-to-one entities in choice fields. See this extended example on how it works. In this
case a list of all users is used in a Choice field to be choosen from:

    use Symfony\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\Form\ValueTransformer\EntityToIDTransformer;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\ChoiceField;

    $userChoices = array();
    $users = $em->getRepository('User')->findAll();
    foreach ($users AS $user) {
        $userChoices[$user->id] = $user->name;
    }

    $userTransformer = new EntityToIDTransformer(array(
        'em' => $em,
        'className' => 'User',
    ));
    $engineerField = new ChoiceField('engineer', array(
        'choices' => $userChoices,
    ));
    $engineerField->setValueTransformer($userTransformer);
    $reporterField = new ChoiceField('reporter', array(
        'choices' => $userChoices,
    ));
    $reporterField->setValueTransformer($userTransformer);

    $form->add($engineerField);
    $form->add($reporterfield);
