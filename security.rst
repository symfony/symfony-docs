    Do you prefer video tutorials? Check out the `Symfony Security screencast series`_.

Symfony's security system is incredibly powerful, but it can also be confusing
to set up. Don't worry! In this article, you'll learn how to set up your app's
security system step-by-step:

#. :ref:`Installing security support <security-installation>`;

#. :ref:`Create your User Class <create-user-class>`;

#. :ref:`Authentication & Firewalls <security-yaml-firewalls>`;

#. :ref:`Denying access to your app (authorization) <security-authorization>`;

#. :ref:`Fetching the current User object <retrieving-the-user-object>`.

A few other important topics are discussed after.

.. _security-installation:

1) Installation
---------------

In applications using :ref:`Symfony Flex <symfony-flex>`, run this command to
install the security feature before using it:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/security-bundle

.. _initial-security-yml-setup-authentication:
.. _initial-security-yaml-setup-authentication:
.. _create-user-class:

2a) Create your User Class
--------------------------

No matter *how* you will authenticate (e.g. login form or API tokens) or *where*
your user data will be stored (database, single sign-on), the next step is always the same:
create a "User" class. The easiest way is to use the `MakerBundle`_.

Let's assume that you want to store your user data in the database with Doctrine:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console make:user

    The name of the security user class (e.g. User) [User]:
    > User

    Do you want to store user data in the database (via Doctrine)? (yes/no) [yes]:
    > yes

    Enter a property name that will be the unique "display" name for the user (e.g.
    email, username, uuid [email]
    > email

    Does this app need to hash/check user passwords? (yes/no) [yes]:
    > yes

    created: src/Entity/User.php
    created: src/Repository/UserRepository.php
    updated: src/Entity/User.php
    updated: config/packages/security.yaml

That's it! The command asks several questions so that it can generate exactly what
you need. The most important is the ``User.php`` file itself. The *only* rule about
your ``User`` class is that it *must* implement :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\User\\UserInterface`.
Feel free to add *any* other fields or logic you need. If your ``User`` class is
an entity (like in this example), you can use the :ref:`make:entity command <doctrine-add-more-fields>`
to add more fields. Also, make sure to make and run a migration for the new entity:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console make:migration
    $ php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

.. _security-user-providers:
.. _where-do-users-come-from-user-providers:

2b) The "User Provider"
-----------------------

In addition to your ``User`` class, you also need a "User provider": a class that
helps with a few things, like reloading the User data from the session and some
optional features, like :doc:`remember me </security/remember_me>` and
:doc:`impersonation </security/impersonating_user>`.

Fortunately, the ``make:user`` command already configured one for you in your
``security.yaml`` file under the ``providers`` key.

If your ``User`` class is an entity, you don't need to do anything else. But if
your class is *not* an entity, then ``make:user`` will also have generated a
``UserProvider`` class that you need to finish. Learn more about user providers
here: :doc:`User Providers </security/user_provider>`.

.. _security-encoding-user-password:
.. _encoding-the-user-s-password:

2c) Encoding Passwords
----------------------

Not all applications have "users" that need passwords. *If* your users have passwords,
you can control how those passwords are encoded in ``security.yaml``. The ``make:user``
command will pre-configure this for you:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/security.yaml
        security:
            # ...

            encoders:
                # use your user class name here
                App\Entity\User:
                    # Use native password encoder
                    # This value auto-selects the best possible hashing algorithm
                    # (i.e. Sodium when available).
                    algorithm: auto

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/packages/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                https://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <config>
                <!-- ... -->

                <encoder class="App\Entity\User"
                    algorithm="auto"
                    cost="12"/>

                <!-- ... -->
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/packages/security.php
        use App\Entity\User;

        $container->loadFromExtension('security', [
            // ...

            'encoders' => [
                User::class => [
                    'algorithm' => 'auto',
                    'cost' => 12,
                ]
            ],

            // ...
        ]);

Now that Symfony knows *how* you want to encode the passwords, you can use the
``UserPasswordEncoderInterface`` service to do this before saving your users to
the database.

For example, by using :ref:`DoctrineFixturesBundle <doctrine-fixtures>`, you can
create dummy database users:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console make:fixtures

    The class name of the fixtures to create (e.g. AppFixtures):
    > UserFixtures

Use this service to encode the passwords:

.. code-block:: diff

    // src/DataFixtures/UserFixtures.php

    + use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\UserPasswordEncoderInterface;
    // ...

    class UserFixtures extends Fixture
    {
    +     private $passwordEncoder;

    +     public function __construct(UserPasswordEncoderInterface $passwordEncoder)
    +     {
    +         $this->passwordEncoder = $passwordEncoder;
    +     }

        public function load(ObjectManager $manager)
        {
            $user = new User();
            // ...

    +         $user->setPassword($this->passwordEncoder->encodePassword(
    +             $user,
    +             'the_new_password'
    +         ));

            // ...
        }
    }

You can manually encode a password by running:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console security:encode-password

.. _security-yaml-firewalls:
.. _security-firewalls:
.. _firewalls-authentication:

3a) Authentication & Firewalls
------------------------------

The security system is configured in ``config/packages/security.yaml``. The *most*
important section is ``firewalls``:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/security.yaml
        security:
            firewalls:
                dev:
                    pattern: ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
                    security: false
                main:
                    anonymous: lazy

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/packages/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                https://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <config>
                <firewall name="dev"
                    pattern="^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/"
                    security="false"/>

                <firewall name="main">
                    <anonymous lazy="true"/>
                </firewall>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/packages/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', [
            'firewalls' => [
                'dev' => [
                    'pattern' => '^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/',
                    'security' => false,
                ],
                'main' => [
                    'anonymous' => 'lazy',
                ],
            ],
        ]);

.. versionadded:: 4.4

    The ``anonymous: lazy`` option was introduced in Symfony 4.4.

A "firewall" is your authentication system: the configuration below it defines
*how* your users will be able to authenticate (e.g. login form, API token, etc).

Only one firewall is active on each request: Symfony uses the ``pattern`` key
to find the first match (you can also :doc:`match by host or other things </security/firewall_restriction>`).
The ``dev`` firewall is really a fake firewall: it just makes sure that you don't
accidentally block Symfony's dev tools - which live under URLs like ``/_profiler``
and ``/_wdt``.

All *real* URLs are handled by the ``main`` firewall (no ``pattern`` key means
it matches *all* URLs). But this does *not* mean that every URL requires authentication.
Nope, thanks to the ``anonymous`` key, this firewall *is* accessible anonymously.

In fact, if you go to the homepage right now, you *will* have access and you'll see
that you're "authenticated" as ``anon.``. Don't be fooled by the "Yes" next to
Authenticated. The firewall verified that it does not know your identity, and so,
you are anonymous:

.. image:: /_images/security/anonymous_wdt.png
   :align: center

You'll learn later how to deny access to certain URLs or controllers.

.. note::

    If you do not see the toolbar, install the :doc:`profiler </profiler>` with:

    .. code-block:: terminal

        $ composer require --dev symfony/profiler-pack

Now that we understand our firewall, the next step is to create a way for your
users to authenticate!

.. _security-form-login:

3b) Authenticating your Users
-----------------------------

Authentication in Symfony can feel a bit "magic" at first. That's because, instead
of building a route & controller to handle login, you'll activate an
*authentication provider*: some code that runs automatically *before* your controller
is called.

Symfony has several :doc:`built-in authentication providers </security/auth_providers>`.
If your use-case matches one of these *exactly*, great! But, in most cases - including
a login form - *we recommend building a Guard Authenticator*: a class that allows
you to control *every* part of the authentication process (see the next section).

.. tip::

    If your application logs users in via a third-party service such as Google,
    Facebook or Twitter (social login), check out the `HWIOAuthBundle`_ community
    bundle.

Guard Authenticators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Guard authenticator is a class that gives you *complete* control over your
authentication process. There are many different ways to build an authenticator;
here are a few common use-cases:

* :doc:`/security/form_login_setup`
* :doc:`/security/guard_authentication` – see this for the most detailed description of
   authenticators and how they work

.. _`security-authorization`:
.. _denying-access-roles-and-other-authorization:

4) Denying Access, Roles and other Authorization
------------------------------------------------

Users can now log in to your app using your login form. Great! Now, you need to learn
how to deny access and work with the User object. This is called **authorization**,
and its job is to decide if a user can access some resource (a URL, a model object,
a method call, ...).

The process of authorization has two different sides:

#. The user receives a specific set of roles when logging in (e.g. ``ROLE_ADMIN``).
#. You add code so that a resource (e.g. URL, controller) requires a specific
   "attribute" (most commonly a role like ``ROLE_ADMIN``) in order to be
   accessed.

Roles
~~~~~

When a user logs in, Symfony calls the ``getRoles()`` method on your ``User``
object to determine which roles this user has. In the ``User`` class that we
generated earlier, the roles are an array that's stored in the database, and
every user is *always* given at least one role: ``ROLE_USER``::

    // src/Entity/User.php
    // ...

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type="json")
     */
    private $roles = [];

    public function getRoles(): array
    {
        $roles = $this->roles;
        // guarantee every user at least has ROLE_USER
        $roles[] = 'ROLE_USER';

        return array_unique($roles);
    }

This is a nice default, but you can do *whatever* you want to determine which roles
a user should have. Here are a few guidelines:

* Every role **must start with** ``ROLE_`` (otherwise, things won't work as expected)

* Other than the above rule, a role is just a string and you can invent what you
  need (e.g. ``ROLE_PRODUCT_ADMIN``).

You'll use these roles next to grant access to specific sections of your site.
You can also use a :ref:`role hierarchy <security-role-hierarchy>` where having
some roles automatically give you other roles.

.. _security-role-authorization:

Add Code to Deny Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are **two** ways to deny access to something:

#. :ref:`access_control in security.yaml <security-authorization-access-control>`
   allows you to protect URL patterns (e.g. ``/admin/*``). Simpler, but less flexible;

#. :ref:`in your controller (or other code) <security-securing-controller>`.

.. _security-authorization-access-control:

Securing URL patterns (access_control)
......................................

The most basic way to secure part of your app is to secure an entire URL pattern
in ``security.yaml``. For example, to require ``ROLE_ADMIN`` for all URLs that
start with ``/admin``, you can:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/security.yaml
        security:
            # ...

            firewalls:
                # ...
                main:
                    # ...

            access_control:
                # require ROLE_ADMIN for /admin*
                - { path: '^/admin', roles: ROLE_ADMIN }

                # or require ROLE_ADMIN or IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY for /admin*
                - { path: '^/admin', roles: [IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY, ROLE_ADMIN] }

                # the 'path' value can be any valid regular expression
                # (this one will match URLs like /api/post/7298 and /api/comment/528491)
                - { path: ^/api/(post|comment)/\d+$, roles: ROLE_USER }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/packages/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"

            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                https://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <config>
                <!-- ... -->

                <firewall name="main">
                    <!-- ... -->
                </firewall>

                <!-- require ROLE_ADMIN for /admin* -->
                <rule path="^/admin" role="ROLE_ADMIN"/>

                <!-- require ROLE_ADMIN or IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY for /admin* -->
                <rule path="^/admin">
                    <role>ROLE_ADMIN</role>
                    <role>IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY</role>
                </rule>

                <!-- the 'path' value can be any valid regular expression
                     (this one will match URLs like /api/post/7298 and /api/comment/528491) -->
                <rule path="^/api/(post|comment)/\d+$" role="ROLE_USER"/>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/packages/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', [
            // ...

            'firewalls' => [
                // ...
                'main' => [
                    // ...
                ],
            ],
            'access_control' => [
                // require ROLE_ADMIN for /admin*
                ['path' => '^/admin', 'roles' => 'ROLE_ADMIN'],

                // require ROLE_ADMIN or IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY for /admin*
                ['path' => '^/admin', 'roles' => ['ROLE_ADMIN', 'IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY']],

                // the 'path' value can be any valid regular expression
                // (this one will match URLs like /api/post/7298 and /api/comment/528491)
                ['path' => '^/api/(post|comment)/\d+$', 'roles' => 'ROLE_USER'],
            ],
        ]);

You can define as many URL patterns as you need - each is a regular expression.
**BUT**, only **one** will be matched per request: Symfony starts at the top of
the list and stops when it finds the first match:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/security.yaml
        security:
            # ...

            access_control:
                # matches /admin/users/*
                - { path: '^/admin/users', roles: ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN }

                # matches /admin/* except for anything matching the above rule
                - { path: '^/admin', roles: ROLE_ADMIN }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/packages/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                https://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <config>
                <!-- ... -->

                <rule path="^/admin/users" role="ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN"/>
                <rule path="^/admin" role="ROLE_ADMIN"/>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/packages/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', [
            // ...

            'access_control' => [
                ['path' => '^/admin/users', 'roles' => 'ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN'],
                ['path' => '^/admin', 'roles' => 'ROLE_ADMIN'],
            ],
        ]);

Prepending the path with ``^`` means that only URLs *beginning* with the
pattern are matched. For example, a path of ``/admin`` (without the ``^``)
would match ``/admin/foo`` but would also match URLs like ``/foo/admin``.

Each ``access_control`` can also match on IP address, hostname and HTTP methods.
It can also be used to redirect a user to the ``https`` version of a URL pattern.
See :doc:`/security/access_control`.

.. _security-securing-controller:

Securing Controllers and other Code
...................................

You can deny access from inside a controller::

    // src/Controller/AdminController.php
    // ...

    public function adminDashboard()
    {
        $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted('ROLE_ADMIN');

        // or add an optional message - seen by developers
        $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted('ROLE_ADMIN', null, 'User tried to access a page without having ROLE_ADMIN');
    }

That's it! If access is not granted, a special
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\AccessDeniedException`
is thrown and no more code in your controller is executed. Then, one of two things
will happen:

1) If the user isn't logged in yet, they will be asked to log in (e.g. redirected
   to the login page).

2) If the user *is* logged in, but does *not* have the ``ROLE_ADMIN`` role, they'll
   be shown the 403 access denied page (which you can
   :ref:`customize <controller-error-pages-by-status-code>`).

.. _security-securing-controller-annotations:

Thanks to the SensioFrameworkExtraBundle, you can also secure your controller
using annotations:

.. code-block:: diff

    // src/Controller/AdminController.php
    // ...

    + use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\IsGranted;

    + /**
    +  * Require ROLE_ADMIN for *every* controller method in this class.
    +  *
    +  * @IsGranted("ROLE_ADMIN")
    +  */
    class AdminController extends AbstractController
    {
    +     /**
    +      * Require ROLE_ADMIN for only this controller method.
    +      *
    +      * @IsGranted("ROLE_ADMIN")
    +      */
        public function adminDashboard()
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

For more information, see the `FrameworkExtraBundle documentation`_.

.. _security-template:

Access Control in Templates
...........................

If you want to check if the current user has a certain role, you can use
the built-in ``is_granted()`` helper function in any Twig template:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    {% if is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN') %}
        <a href="...">Delete</a>
    {% endif %}

Securing other Services

See :doc:`/security/securing_services`.

Checking to see if a User is Logged In (IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you *only* want to check if a user is logged in (you don't care about roles),
you have two options. First, if you've given *every* user ``ROLE_USER``, you can
just check for that role. Otherwise, you can use a special "attribute" in place
of a role::

    // ...

    public function adminDashboard()
    {
        $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY');

        // ...
    }

You can use ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY`` anywhere roles are used: like
``access_control`` or in Twig.

``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY`` isn't a role, but it kind of acts like one, and every
user that has logged in will have this. Actually, there are 3 special attributes
like this:

* ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED``: *All* logged in users have this, even
  if they are logged in because of a "remember me cookie". Even if you don't
  use the :doc:`remember me functionality </security/remember_me>`,
  you can use this to check if the user is logged in.

* ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY``: This is similar to ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED``,
  but stronger. Users who are logged in only because of a "remember me cookie"
  will have ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED`` but will not have ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY``.

* ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY``: *All* users (even anonymous ones) have
  this - this is useful when *whitelisting* URLs to guarantee access - some
  details are in :doc:`/security/access_control`.

.. _security-secure-objects:

Access Control Lists (ACLs): Securing individual Database Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine you are designing a blog where users can comment on your posts. You
also want a user to be able to edit their own comments, but not those of
other users. Also, as the admin user, you want to be able to edit *all* comments.

:doc:`Voters </security/voters>` allow you to write *whatever* business logic you
need (e.g. the user can edit this post because they are the creator) to determine
access. That's why voters are officially recommended by Symfony to create ACL-like
security systems.

If you still prefer to use traditional ACLs, refer to the `Symfony ACL bundle`_.

.. _retrieving-the-user-object:

5a) Fetching the User Object
----------------------------

After authentication, the ``User`` object of the current user can be accessed
via the ``getUser()`` shortcut::

    public function index()
    {
        // usually you'll want to make sure the user is authenticated first
        $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY');

        // returns your User object, or null if the user is not authenticated
        // use inline documentation to tell your editor your exact User class
        /** @var \App\Entity\User $user */
        $user = $this->getUser();

        // Call whatever methods you've added to your User class
        // For example, if you added a getFirstName() method, you can use that.
        return new Response('Well hi there '.$user->getFirstName());
    }

5b) Fetching the User from a Service
------------------------------------

If you need to get the logged in user from a service, use the
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Security` service::

    // src/Service/ExampleService.php
    // ...

    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Security;

    class ExampleService
    {
        private $security;

        public function __construct(Security $security)
        {
            // Avoid calling getUser() in the constructor: auth may not
            // be complete yet. Instead, store the entire Security object.
            $this->security = $security;
        }

        public function someMethod()
        {
            // returns User object or null if not authenticated
            $user = $this->security->getUser();
        }
    }

Fetch the User in a Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a Twig Template the user object is available via the ``app.user`` variable
thanks to the :ref:`Twig global app variable <twig-app-variable>`:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    {% if is_granted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY') %}
        <p>Email: {{ app.user.email }}</p>
    {% endif %}

.. _security-logging-out:

Logging Out
-----------

To enable logging out, activate the  ``logout`` config parameter under your firewall:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/security.yaml
        security:
            # ...

            firewalls:
                main:
                    # ...
                    logout: ~

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/packages/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                https://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <config>
                <!-- ... -->

                <firewall name="secured_area">
                    <!-- ... -->
                    <logout/>
                </firewall>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/packages/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', [
            // ...

            'firewalls' => [
                'secured_area' => [
                    // ...
                    'logout' => [],
                ],
            ],
        ]);


And that's it! By sending a user to ``/logout``, Symfony will un-authenticate
the current user.

If you want to change the path from the default ``/logout`` to a custom url,
you need to set the `path` option *and* setup a matching route like this:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/security.yaml
        security:
            # ...

            firewalls:
                main:
                    # ...
                    logout:
                        path:   /my-logout

                        # where to redirect after logout
                        # target: app_any_route

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/packages/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                https://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <config>
                <!-- ... -->

                <firewall name="secured_area">
                    <!-- ... -->
                    <logout path="/my-logout"/>
                </firewall>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/packages/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', [
            // ...

            'firewalls' => [
                'secured_area' => [
                    // ...
                    'logout' => ['path' => '/my-logout'],
                ],
            ],
        ]);

Now you need to create a route for this URL (but not a controller):

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php-annotations

        // src/Controller/SecurityController.php
        namespace App\Controller;

        use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

        class SecurityController extends AbstractController
        {
            /**
             * @Route("/my-logout", name="app_logout", methods={"GET"})
             */
            public function logout()
            {
                // controller can be blank: it will never be executed!
                throw new \Exception('Don\'t forget to activate logout in security.yaml');
            }
        }

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/routes.yaml
        app_logout:
            path: /my-logout
            methods: GET

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/routes.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <routes xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/routing"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/routing
                https://symfony.com/schema/routing/routing-1.0.xsd">

            <route id="app_logout" path="/my-logout" methods="GET"/>
        </routes>

    ..  code-block:: php

        // config/routes.php
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\Loader\Configurator\RoutingConfigurator;

        return function (RoutingConfigurator $routes) {
            $routes->add('app_logout', '/my-logout')
                ->methods(['GET'])
            ;
        };

.. tip::

    Need more control of what happens after logout? Add a ``success_handler`` key
    under ``logout`` and point it to a service id of a class that implements
    :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Http\\Logout\\LogoutSuccessHandlerInterface`.

.. _security-role-hierarchy:

Hierarchical Roles
------------------

Instead of giving many roles to each user, you can define role inheritance
rules by creating a role hierarchy:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/security.yaml
        security:
            # ...

            role_hierarchy:
                ROLE_ADMIN:       ROLE_USER
                ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: [ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH]

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/packages/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                https://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <config>
                <!-- ... -->

                <role id="ROLE_ADMIN">ROLE_USER</role>
                <role id="ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN">ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH</role>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/packages/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', [
            // ...

            'role_hierarchy' => [
                'ROLE_ADMIN'       => 'ROLE_USER',
                'ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN' => [
                    'ROLE_ADMIN',
                    'ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH',
                ],
            ],
        ]);

Users with the ``ROLE_ADMIN`` role will also have the
``ROLE_USER`` role. And users with ``ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN``, will automatically have
``ROLE_ADMIN``, ``ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH`` and ``ROLE_USER`` (inherited from ``ROLE_ADMIN``).

For role hierarchy to work, do not try to call ``$user->getRoles()`` manually.
For example, in a controller extending from the :ref:`base controller <the-base-controller-class-services>`::

    // BAD - $user->getRoles() will not know about the role hierarchy
    $hasAccess = in_array('ROLE_ADMIN', $user->getRoles());

    // GOOD - use of the normal security methods
    $hasAccess = $this->isGranted('ROLE_ADMIN');
    $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted('ROLE_ADMIN');

.. note::

    The ``role_hierarchy`` values are static - you can't, for example, store the
    role hierarchy in a database. If you need that, create a custom
    :doc:`security voter </security/voters>` that looks for the user roles
    in the database.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Can I have Multiple Firewalls?**
    Yes! But it's usually not necessary. Each firewall is like a separate security
    system. And so, unless you have *very* different authentication needs, one
    firewall usually works well. With :doc:`Guard authentication </security/guard_authentication>`,
    you can create various, diverse ways of allowing authentication (e.g. form login,
    API key authentication and LDAP) all under the same firewall.

**Can I Share Authentication Between Firewalls?**
    Yes, but only with some configuration. If you're using multiple firewalls and
    you authenticate against one firewall, you will *not* be authenticated against
    any other firewalls automatically. Different firewalls are like different security
    systems. To do this you have to explicitly specify the same
    :ref:`reference-security-firewall-context` for different firewalls. But usually
    for most applications, having one main firewall is enough.

**Security doesn't seem to work on my Error Pages**
    As routing is done *before* security, 404 error pages are not covered by
    any firewall. This means you can't check for security or even access the
    user object on these pages. See :doc:`/controller/error_pages`
    for more details.

**My Authentication Doesn't Seem to Work: No Errors, but I'm Never Logged In**
    Sometimes authentication may be successful, but after redirecting, you're
    logged out immediately due to a problem loading the ``User`` from the session.
    To see if this is an issue, check your log file (``var/log/dev.log``) for
    the log message:

**Cannot refresh token because user has changed**
    If you see this, there are two possible causes. First, there may be a problem
    loading your User from the session. See :ref:`user_session_refresh`. Second,
    if certain user information was changed in the database since the last page
    refresh, Symfony will purposely log out the user for security reasons.
