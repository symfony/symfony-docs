@jevgenijusr This change looks good to me. Can you also update the following code blocks for the XML and PHP formats accordingly?

@jevgenijusr this looks like a bug. Thanks for fixing it!  However, shouldn't we use `Rot13Transformer` instead of `UppercaseTransformer` ? That's what's used in the first part of the article.

@javiereguiluz Thanks, I think we should use `UppercaseRot13Transformer` instead, small change in the end :)
