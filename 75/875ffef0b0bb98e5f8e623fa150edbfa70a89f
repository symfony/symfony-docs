Did you try this? Symfony 3.3 should support this notation IIRC.

@xabbuh I did try this (I can give you the link to the repo if needed). And it doesn't work on Symfony 3.3.

What Symfony 3.3 introduced is a short syntax to define arguments (see [here](http://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-3-simpler-service-configuration#short-syntax-for-service-configuration)).
In the current docs, it doesn't work as `routing.loader` is passed as if it were an argument, instead of a tag.
