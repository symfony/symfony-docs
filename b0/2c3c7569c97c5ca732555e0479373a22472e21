about lazy loading a command: https://symfony.com/doc/current/console/commands_as_services.html#lazy-loading

Are lazy loaded commands better in every situation? Should this contain a link to the `commands_as_services` docs?

A link to https://symfony.com/doc/current/console/commands_as_services.html#lazy-loading sounds good, @ndench. Where should its place be?

I do not know if lazy loading is a good idea in all situations. As mentioned in `commands_as_services`, `->addAlias()` must be handled. Any suggestions of situations?

I think I would not add the link. This is just working and adding a cross-reference to another article may be more confusing.

I'm not fussed either way. As long as there is somewhere in the docs that explain that lazy loading isn't the only way to write commands.

Maybe instead of replacing the non lazy way, add another example under it where the lazy load is mentioned with a static property?

This should really be the way to go 99% of the time
