Hi @WouterJ.
I based this change in this [doc entry](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/class_loader/psr4_class_loader.html):
> All Symfony components follow PSR-4.

@WouterJ technically, our codebase respects both PSR-0 and PSR-4, given that it is not impacted by the difference between them (we don't use underscores in class names).
the fact that we register the composer autoloader with PSR-0 rather than PSR-4 does not mean we are not compatible with PSR-4

@fabpot what's your opinion on this?

I think we should merge this PR. I've flagged it as Finished and @weaverryan will merge it sometime :)

Thanks @phansys and sorry for the delay!
