I intended to merge this with branch 2.3, not sure what I did wrong

:+1: for the fixed typo.

Regarding the title case, Symfony uses a very strange title case variant which is mentioned here (http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/documentation/standards.html#english-language-standards). My guess is that this title:

```
How to set up before and after Filters
```

Should be spelled instead as:

```
How to Set Up Before and After Filters
```

@javiereguiluz You are right about these weird english capitalization rules, changed to what you suggested

Actually, aren't "before" and "after" closed class words and need to be lowercased?

Maybe you are right... what about "up"? Probably it should not be uppercase either.
OMG this is turning more complicated than what it sounded :-)

I am always confused about this rule too. :) Though I think "Up" should be uppercased as it is part of the verb.

@GuGuss Is there an issue with our service hook or is there some other thing going wrong with our platform.sh integration?

I found these pages with rules for capitalization:

According to them the capitalization is correct now

@xabbuh You're right this time ;) PRs aren't built anymore. I'll check what's happening.
