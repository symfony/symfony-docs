@javiereguiluz Hi. Before I will add info about the attributes in constraints, could I receive some review about the message and position of the message?
In my opinion, it should be between the table and `Basic Usage` header.
The message:

    The ability to use PHP attributes to configure constraints was introduced in
    Symfony 5.2. Prior to this, Doctrine Annotations were the only way to
    annotate field of a class with constraint configuration.

I would love to get your review here @derrabus üëç  Thanks

@wkania I am not sure if we need this information, the code examples are only available in the `5.2` docs ü§î

I don't think that we want to have this `versionadded` block on each constraint page. On some overview article that describes the various ways a developer might configure constraints, this block is certainly helpful, though.

Hi @OskarStark , @derrabus , @xabbuh , @maxhelias
From what I see, @HeahDude  is a [former member of docs team](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/14824).
What about his review of this pull request?
