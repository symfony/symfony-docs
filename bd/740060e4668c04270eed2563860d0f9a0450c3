See @dmaicher's [comment](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/17529#issuecomment-204534951) which also explains the only use case of this option:
> So it only works for use cases where the form POST comes from a different page than /login
> Maybe its meant to be used if you have the login form embedded in the header of your page or something. So once you logged in you get redirected back to the page where the POST came from.
