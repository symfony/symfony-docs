I think "tens of" is correct. Let's see what our native speaker @weaverryan thinks.

It was meant to be "tens" but it's not a super common phrase. The problem with tons is that it has a negative connotation. Our point here is not to say that there are a ton of config files, but that there *are* config files and they have different formats. I think we should keep it or (better) rephrase the whole sentence :).

Thanks!

@weaverryan Is some thing like "lots of configuration files" more clear?

Let's use "several" :)
