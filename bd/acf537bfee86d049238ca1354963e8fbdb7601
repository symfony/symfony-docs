@javiereguiluz given that the bridge has more and more features, wouldn't it be better to split its doc into multiple chapters instead, as done for other components ?

I've changed everything reviewers suggested. I also agree with @stof and we should split this doc as soon as we try to add the explanation of a new feature.

Ready for the final review before merge. Thanks!

As this PR is adding explanations of new features, I would say it is time :smile:

@stof I was referring to new explanations after this feature :grin:

I am :+1: for merging this as is. If someone feels the need to split the component's documentation with this feature set, we can discuss that in a new PR, but don't block merging this one because of a new discussion.
