We should probably explain that all modern browsers support these methods in XHR, but that HTML forms still can only use GET and POST.

You're right. I'll get on to it :)

Oh, and we also have a part talking about this at http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/routing/method_parameters.html#faking-the-method-with-method. Could you please address that section too?

@wouthoekstra By the way, we don't receive notifications when new commits are pushed to a pull request (I just discovered your update "accidentally"). So next time it's better to leave a comment after you did some changes. :)

Ah thx for the tip xabbuh, didn't know that! Glad the alterations are okay :)
