Good catch :+1:

The parameter is deprecated anyway, but having this wrong in the 4.3 and 4.4 docs can be annoying.

Do you know since when its deprecated?

Because there is a `.. deprecated::` missing:
https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/reference/configuration/kernel#log-directory
https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/kernel.html#log-directory

It's deprecated since 4.2, see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/bfd308ff4ada2adb235c8db71350aa49cdf5d6d3/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/Kernel.php#L683-L688

I created a PR to add the missing directive:
