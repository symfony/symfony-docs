What do you think about removing the parameters entirely and putting the class names directly into the service definitions? There is no benefit in using the parameters.

Following the Symfony best practices it would make sense to remove the parameters.
Will try to do it later when having some free time

I agree. @WouterJ or @weaverryan can merge this once they have some time. Thank you for your great job as always @ifdattic!
