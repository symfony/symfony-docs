I've added `[WCM]` to your title, Waiting Code Merge. Could you please add the [PR format](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/documentation/overview.html#pull-request-format)?

Yo Marek!

It looks like your feature was merged (congrats!). Can you make the tweaks suggested by @WouterJ? This is ready to merge once those are taken care of :).

Thanks!

Yup, it's scheduled for this weekend. Hope it's not to late ?

It's never to late to make the docs better :) Docs don't have a release, like the code.

I've improved the documentation according to your comments. Thanks for them!
