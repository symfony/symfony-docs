What about using a `caution` directive for this?

I'm usually against admonitions because in my opinion they break the reading flow and they're very annoying. But if other people agree with @xabbuh's suggestion, I'll do it.

I like a caution too

@xabbuh @WouterJ as requested, I've added the new documentation inside a `caution` admonition.

In my opinion this PR can be considered *finished* and ready to be merged.
