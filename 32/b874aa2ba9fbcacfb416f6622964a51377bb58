Thanks for your quick review, @javiereguiluz! I've added this to the docbot reviewers and found a couple more occurences. Fixed them & pushed again :heavy_check_mark:

@WouterJ shouldn't you fix the 2.3 branch first, and then fix 2.7 after merging 2.3 into it ?

@stof thanks for noticing it. I've done the changes against 2.3, but it seems that I choose the wrong branch for the PR.

So @weaverryan, in case you merge this PR, it should be switched to 2.3.

@javiereguiluz you can try it yourself with a (very on-the-edge) release of the docbot: https://github.com/WouterJ/docbot
