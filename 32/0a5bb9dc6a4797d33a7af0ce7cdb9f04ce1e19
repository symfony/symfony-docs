@OskarStark I like this idea. You can also add me for form and validator related files.

Of course ! Thanks for the idea

Be careful, the file should be on master (this is a bit weird btw)

It will be upmerged to the upper branches after the merge, or what do you mean? 🤔

Oh Yes! they updated their workflow. (https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners)

During the initial release, they **always** took the CODEOWER file in the default branch (master), even if the PR were submitted to another branch (3.4).

This is not the case anymore, this is much better

Please add me too! Can we use https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/.github/CODEOWNERS as reference?

Sure we can for the initial things, but it’s quite different and not possible to use it 1:1 overall. Let’s go step by step 😊 I will try to keep things up to date.
