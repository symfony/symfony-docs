Ryan and me were discussing about another page in https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/17364, namely https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_collections.html#allowing-new-tags-with-the-prototype

I wasn't even aware that this JavaScript code exists on https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types/collection.html as well ;-) So given the fact that it's hard enough to maintain this entire collections/JavaScript topic in one place, I think **those two pages/parts should be merged.**
If you agree with that in principle, the question would be: Which one should contain everything, and which one mainly a link to the other?

Besides that, I agree that getting rid of jQuery is a good idea :-)

Oh geez, same for me. Let's merge - I would make https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_collections.html#allowing-new-tags-with-the-prototype the source of truth and link from the reference, but either is fine.

The easiest move and the one that make sense, is to remove the subsection `collection.html#adding-and-removing-items`
That page already has multiple links to `https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_collections.html#allowing-new-tags-with-the-prototype`
