I actually think, that the previous version is correct. In the end, the top-level `fingers_crossed` handler is wrapping swift, so it is indeed a "mail" handler.

Yes but the convention is to have a `fingers_crossed` called `main` https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/3.4/app/config/config_prod.yml#L12, so I do think it is typo too.
