-1, it isn't done in the Symfony standard, so it shouldn't belong here. /cc @fabpot

:-1: for the same reasons

Symfony does not put spaces around ``!`` (the Symfony rule would be the opposite actually)

That makes sense. I will submit a pull request with the opposite
clarification.

Alright; as discussed, I have added a clarification to the opposite affect.

I'm still not sure if it is really necessary to add this clarification. Let's see what the others think.

@xabbuh  Thanks--I corrected the errors you mentioned.

Personally, I think the clarification is worth while as it would save folks like me some time. All the well-organized projects I had worked on until recently have had the bang spacing, and the current wording would seem to say that is the right way.

The only reason I discovered the discrepancy was my having another pull request to a symfony-based project critiqued on that front, and reading a more specific coding standard would have saved me the trouble of having to go back through and adjust them all.

the right way to say it would be ``Add a space around binary operators (except the concatenation)``. the sentence here does not apply to any of the unary operators (``!``, ``++``, ``--``)

@stof: I modified the language as you suggested. What do you think?

@stof This looks sensible to me, but I'd like to have your +1 on it before I merge.
