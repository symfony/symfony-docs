Thatâ€™s correct! My vote is to only show the ->getUser() way, with a note (maybe inline comment in code?) that says you can also type-hint a UserInterface arg.

Changed that. Any particular reason not to use type-hinting in this case? Or is it just because of the better style?

@weaverryan Thank you for proposing these changes, I implemented them in my latest commit. Creating a base class which returns your custom User for autocompletion is actually a really nice idea, which I am going to implement myself. Thanks for that :)
