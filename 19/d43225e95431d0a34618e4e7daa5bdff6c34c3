I'm not sure, but this look like a Bug to me, how does the tests look like for this case?

seems that there is no testcase for this case?

At least, the behaviour as described by @javiereguiluz is consistent with what common commands in UNIX shells do (afaik this is described somewhere). So I would simply change the docs accordingly.

@xabbuh you are right, i added a PR with a test case, maybe you can have a look on it.

Thank you

This definitely looks like a doc issue. The code behavior is considered correct (although it may be  counterintuitive). If this is true, could we consider this PR finished? Thanks!
