I think https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/master/reference/configuration/security.rst should be updated too, all the `security.acl` configuration node has been deprecated and will be removed in 4.0 (now available as `acl` when using `symfony/acl-bundle`).

@javiereguiluz I agree - can you update the reference section?

I've added a note about ACL deprecation in the security config reference ... and we'll remove it in `master`.
