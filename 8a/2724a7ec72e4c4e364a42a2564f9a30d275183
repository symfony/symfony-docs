Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.3, 5.4, 6.0, 6.1.

Cheers!

Totally in favor of listing these form types.

My only question is about organization, especially future-proof organization. Do we want to mix UX types with regular types ... or do we group all UX types in a dedicated section to add some text and link explaining that they need Symfony UX, etc. ?

@javiereguiluz I've moved them to their own little section
