I've tried this in Windows and not work for me :/

```
...\symfony-docs\_build>make html
Running Sphinx v1.3.1
making output directory...
A Translator for the html builder is changed.
loading pickled environment... not yet created
building [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of date

Build finished. The HTML pages are in _build/html.
```
... and the path `_build/html` is empty.

:question:

@yceruto the error seems to be in this line:

```
WARNING: master file ...\symfony-docs\_build\index.rst not found
```

`make html` should be run in `\symfony-docs`. (using `"_build/make" html` or `_build\make html`)

@wouterj `symfony-docs>_build\make html` work perfect, thanks.

On the other hand, inside `symfony-docs/_build/_theme/_templates/layout.html` was declared the main assets to external urls:
* css `http://symfony.com/css/compiled/v5/all.css?v=4`
* js `http://symfony.com/js/v5/all.js?v=4`

this not work offline, any solution ?

The same for all *.svg paths inside `http://symfony.com/css/compiled/v5/all.css`, they aren't offline.

I just created a separate issue for these questions, because they are out of scope of this PR. https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/6844
