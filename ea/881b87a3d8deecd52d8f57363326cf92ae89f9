You could also add the missing use statement for the HttpKernel component (see https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/5556#discussion_r35374644).

That was the original reason for doing this PR, but it turns out it isn't missing. It's included in a previous chapter or code example.

Then we need to do it for 99% of the examples (as it's a tutorial, all code examples are an improvement of the previous shown example)
