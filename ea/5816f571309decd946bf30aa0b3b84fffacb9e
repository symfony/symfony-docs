You're correct about the value type. In the Inherited Options sections, add a new thing at first which starts with: " These options inherit from the :doc:`checkbox </reference/forms/types/checkbox>` type:" and then document the value option

@WouterJ The `value` option has it's own file now and I tweaked the content a little bit to also fit with radios.

Can you rebase this?

@xabbuh Ups, that was a rebase on master by mistake. Mh, good question how to roll this back...

@xabbuh Now the rebase should be okay.

:+1: great @bicpi, this should make life easier for @weaverryan since #3416 was merged in the meantime

yes, it's succesfully rebased!
