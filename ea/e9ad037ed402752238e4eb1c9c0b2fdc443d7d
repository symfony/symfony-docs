This makes sense, but to be difficult, is there value in showing both ways? Should we pick just *one* of the ways and show it? Disagree?

What do you mean with both ways, @weaverryan? A single file vs. multiple files?

I mean showing:

```twig
{% form_theme form '::common.html.twig' ':Form:fields.html.twig' %}
```

AND

```twig
{% form_theme form with ['::common.html.twig', ':Form:fields.html.twig'] %}
```

I think we should just pick *one* of these formats and not show the other one. I don't believe there is a difference between the 2 functionally.

The ``with`` syntax allows to use any valid Twig expression, which means you can use variables in it

my suggestion is to document the ``with`` syntax. The syntax without ``with`` is the older syntax from 2.0

I agree with Stof. @javiereguiluz if you agree, can we just show the `with` syntax?

@stof @weaverryan thanks for your suggestions! I've just removed the old syntax explanation.

@weaverryan excuse me for taking so long to fix the error that you reported. I think that now everything is OK to merge it.
