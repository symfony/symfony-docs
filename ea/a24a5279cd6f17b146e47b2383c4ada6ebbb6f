Hey! Can you open a new PR? It looks like something got messed up here :/.

@weaverryan I changed the base branch to `4.3` and from now on `4.2` is EOM. So everything is correct üëç

Can you please review the PR? Thank you üòÉ

@weaverryan: Yes, I originally made it to the 4.3 branch, but later moved it to 4.2. That gave the errors, sorry.

I saw later that in 4.0 and 4.1 there was documentation on the --disable-host-check option, but removed in 4.2. I took me quite some time to figure this out. You need the this --disable-host-check in case the dev-server and your domain/ip are different. Additionally, you need the --port option, but this might also be related to an issue, see https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/issues/565.
