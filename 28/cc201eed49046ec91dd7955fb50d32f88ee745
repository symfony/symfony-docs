Nice work @stampycode. These changes should imo be made for the `2.3` branch, but we can (probably) easily apply them there.

@stampycode Is this based off the `2.7` branch or off `2.3`?

This is based off `2.7`, since that's the first version in which the deprecations were made (I think).

I think it's totally fine if we merge it into the `2.3` branch (the code was updated there too).

@weaverryan @WouterJ @javiereguiluz What do you think?

@xabbuh I agree with you. Let's merge it in 2.3 because this change was exceptionally made in that branch too.

:+1: for 2.3 - if that's what we did in the code
