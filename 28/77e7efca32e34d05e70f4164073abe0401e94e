IIUC, the support for this option was actually added after [this fix](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/54673/commits/6a1f08db12271d6f02a5fff7cae7fcb6e2ff2dd9), in version `6.4.7`.
So, I guess this PR should target (at least) the branch 6.4.

@phansys  should I change the suggested branch for the PR?

>@phansys should I change the suggested branch for the PR?

I'd say yes, at least to branch 6.4. Maybe the core members could suggest a previous one.

BTW, if the `ssl` option is intended to expose the [PHP SSL context](https://www.php.net/manual/en/context.ssl.php), I guess we should add a link to the documentation for these options, document the current ones and left a comment that they might change with the time.

@phansys  I tried changing the base, but I'll wait untill @xabbuh  or @OskarStark  comment on the issue of correct branch.

6.4 looks correct to me
