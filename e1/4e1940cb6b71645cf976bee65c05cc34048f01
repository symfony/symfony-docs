Thanks for proposing this change Javier. However, we already have an example in http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/conventions.html#deprecations. Isn't that enough?

Thank you for the feedback @xabbuh. That example is what I've referenced before.
Indeed I think this PR aims to use an standardized syntax for messages inside `trigger_error()` calls (the same which is currently used for exception messages), regardless they are for deprecation notices or not.

I think you should then also add a link to the other section.

@xabbuh, I don't know how to create a link to another doc's anchor. Moreover, I can't find anything documented at [Adding Links](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/documentation/format.html#adding-links) section.

Could you please give me some clue?
Thanks in advance.

Sorry for not replying earlier. I completely missed your question. You can link to that section by using the sections label with the `ref`role like this, for example:

```rst
Read more at :ref:`contributing-code-conventions-deprecations`.
```
