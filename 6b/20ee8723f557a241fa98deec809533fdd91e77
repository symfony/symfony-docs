Hi,

I perfectly understand that ; my feeling is that there should be a way to
avoid this pitfall.
It would be a pitty to discourage users for such a basic error (that i
made, being an experimented developper), just because copy/paste of the
first sample doesn't work immediately...

Since this is the first hand-created file in the tutorial, i though of this
addition in first place, but i agree that this may not be the right
solution to keep the documentation coherent.

Maybe there could be a warning before, or as an alternative, the user may
be directed to file generation (php bin/console make:controller
LuckyController) ?

At last, the "real" problem may not be in the documentation : the error
message i got in the console tells me the file was found but not the
controller class inside ; i though of errors in namespaces, uses, class
declaration, missing brackets, ...
Maybe the message could tell something like "or this file is not a valid
php file" ?

Hope that could help.

Regards
