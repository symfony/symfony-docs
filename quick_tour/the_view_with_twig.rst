Final Thoughts
--------------

You have only been working with Symfony for about 20 minutes, and you can
already do pretty amazing stuff with it. That's the power of Symfony. Learning
the basics is easy, and you will soon learn that this simplicity is hidden
under a very flexible architecture.

But I get ahead of myself. First, you need to learn more about the controller
and that's exactly the topic of the next part of this tutorial. Ready for
another 10 minutes with Symfony?
