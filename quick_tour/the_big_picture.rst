The Big Picture
===============

This first part will teach you how to develop a simple Symfony2 project in 10
minutes! If you've used a web framework before, you should feel right at home
with Symfony2. If not, welcome to a whole new way of developing web applications.

Installing Symfony2
-------------------

First, check that the PHP version installed on your computer meets the Symfony2
requirements: 5.3.3 or higher. Then, open a console and execute the following
command to install the latest version of Symfony2 in the ``myproject/``
directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition myproject/ ~2.4

.. note::

    `Composer`_ is the package manager used by modern PHP applications and the
    only recommended way to install Symfony2. To install Composer on your
    Linux or Mac system, execute the following commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
        $ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

    To install Composer on a Windows system, download the `executable installer`_.

Beware that the first time you install Symfony2, it may take a few minutes to
download all its components. At the end of the installation process, the
installer will ask you to provide some configuration options for the Symfony2
project. For this first project you can safely ignore this configuration by
pressing the ``<Enter>`` key repeatedly.

Running Symfony2
----------------

Before running Symfony2 for the first time, execute the following command to
make sure that your system meets all the technical requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd myproject/
    $ php app/check.php

Fix any error reported by the command and then, use the PHP built-in web server
to run Symfony:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console server:run

Open your browser and access to the ``http://localhost:8000/app_dev.php`` URL to
see the Welcome page of Symfony2:

.. image:: /images/quick_tour/welcome.png
   :align: center
   :alt:   Symfony2 Welcome Page

The built-in web server is available for PHP 5.4.0 or higher. If you have an
older version of PHP or if you prefer a traditional web server such as Apache
or Nginx, read the :doc:`/cookbook/configuration/web_server_configuration`
article.

Understanding the Fundamentals
------------------------------

One of the main goals of a framework is to keep your code organized and allow
your application to evolve easily over time by avoiding the mixing of database
calls, HTML tags, and business logic in the same script. To achieve this goal
with Symfony, you'll first need to learn a few fundamental concepts and terms.

Symfony comes with some sample code that you can use to learn more about its
main concepts. Go to the following URL to be greeted by Symfony2 (replace
*Fabien* with your first name):

.. code-block:: text

    http://localhost:8000/app_dev.php/demo/hello/Fabien

.. image:: /images/quick_tour/hello_fabien.png
   :align: center

What's going on here? Have a look at each part of the URL:

* ``app_dev.php``: this is a :term:`front controller`. It is the unique entry
  point of the application and it responds to all user requests;

* ``/demo/hello/Fabien``: this is the *virtual path* to the resource the user
  wants to access.

Your responsibility as a developer is to write the code that maps the user's
*request* (``/demo/hello/Fabien``) to the *resource* associated with it
(the ``Hello Fabien!`` HTML page).

Routing
~~~~~~~

Symfony2 routes the request to the code that handles it by matching the
requested URL (i.e. the virtual path) against some configured paths. The demo
paths are defined in the ``app/config/routing_dev.yml`` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing_dev.yml
    # ...

    # AcmeDemoBundle routes (to be removed)
    _acme_demo:
        resource: "@AcmeDemoBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"

The ``_acme_demo`` routes are imported from a ``routing.yml`` file that lives
inside the AcmeDemoBundle:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
    _welcome:
        path:     /
        defaults: { _controller: AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index }

    _demo:
        resource: "@AcmeDemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php"
        type:     annotation
        prefix:   /demo

    # ...

The first three lines (after the comment) define the code that is executed
when the user requests the "``/``" resource (i.e. the welcome page you saw
earlier). When requested, the ``AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index`` controller
will be executed. In the next section, you'll learn exactly what that means.

.. tip::

    In addition to YAML files, routes can be configured in XML or PHP files
    and even embedded in PHP annotations. This flexibility is one of the main
    features of Symfony2, a framework that never imposes you a particular
    configuration format.

Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~

A controller is a PHP function or method that handles incoming *requests* and
returns *responses* (often HTML code). Instead of using the PHP global variables
and functions (like ``$_GET`` or ``header()``) to manage these HTTP messages
Symfony uses objects: :ref:`Request<component-http-foundation-request>`
and :ref:`Response<component-http-foundation-response>`. The simplest possible
controller might create the response by hand, based on the request::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    $name = $request->get('name');

    return new Response('Hello '.$name);

Symfony2 chooses the controller based on the ``_controller`` value from the
routing configuration: ``AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index``. This string is the
controller *logical name*, and it references the ``indexAction`` method from
the ``Acme\DemoBundle\Controller\WelcomeController`` class::

    // src/Acme/DemoBundle/Controller/WelcomeController.php
    namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Controller;

    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;

    class WelcomeController extends Controller
    {
        public function indexAction()
        {
            return $this->render('AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index.html.twig');
        }
    }

.. tip::

    You could have used the full class and method name -
    ``Acme\DemoBundle\Controller\WelcomeController::indexAction`` - for the
    ``_controller`` value. But using the logical name is shorter and allows
    for more flexibility.

The ``WelcomeController`` class extends the built-in ``Controller`` class,
which provides useful shortcut methods, like the
:ref:`render()<controller-rendering-templates>` method that loads and renders
a template (``AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index.html.twig``). The returned value
is a ``Response`` object populated with the rendered content. So, if the need
arises, the ``Response`` can be tweaked before it is sent to the browser::

    public function indexAction()
    {
        $response = $this->render('AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index.txt.twig');
        $response->headers->set('Content-Type', 'text/plain');

        return $response;
    }

No matter how you do it, the end goal of your controller is always to return
the ``Response`` object that should be delivered back to the user. This ``Response``
object can be populated with HTML code, represent a client redirect, or even
return the contents of a JPG image with a ``Content-Type`` header of ``image/jpg``.

The template name, ``AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index.html.twig``, is the template
*logical name* and it references the ``Resources/views/Welcome/index.html.twig``
file inside the AcmeDemoBundle (located at ``src/Acme/DemoBundle``).
The `Bundles`_ section below will explain why this is useful.

Now, take a look at the routing configuration again and find the ``_demo``
key:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
    # ...
    _demo:
        resource: "@AcmeDemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php"
        type:     annotation
        prefix:   /demo

The *logical name* of the file containing the ``_demo`` routes is
``@AcmeDemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php`` and refers
to the ``src/Acme/DemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php`` file. In this
file, routes are defined as annotations on action methods::

    // src/Acme/DemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php
    use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;
    use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Template;

    class DemoController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * @Route("/hello/{name}", name="_demo_hello")
         * @Template()
         */
        public function helloAction($name)
        {
            return array('name' => $name);
        }

        // ...
    }

The ``@Route()`` annotation creates a new route matching the ``/hello/{name}``
path to the ``helloAction()`` method. Any string enclosed in curly brackets,
like ``{name}``, is considered a variable that can be directly retrieved as a
method argument with the same name.

If you take a closer look at the controller code, you can see that instead of
rendering a template and returning a ``Response`` object like before, it
just returns an array of parameters. The ``@Template()`` annotation tells
Symfony to render the template for you, passing to it each variable of the
returned array. The name of the template that's rendered follows the name
of the controller. So, in this example, the ``AcmeDemoBundle:Demo:hello.html.twig``
template is rendered (located at ``src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/views/Demo/hello.html.twig``).

Templates
~~~~~~~~~

The controller renders the ``src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/views/Demo/hello.html.twig``
template (or ``AcmeDemoBundle:Demo:hello.html.twig`` if you use the logical name):

.. code-block:: jinja

    {# src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/views/Demo/hello.html.twig #}
    {% extends "AcmeDemoBundle::layout.html.twig" %}

    {% block title "Hello " ~ name %}

    {% block content %}
        <h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
    {% endblock %}

By default, Symfony2 uses `Twig`_ as its template engine but you can also use
traditional PHP templates if you choose. The
:doc:`second part of this tutorial</quick_tour/the_view>` will introduce how
templates work in Symfony2.

Bundles
~~~~~~~

You might have wondered why the :term:`Bundle` word is used in many names you
have seen so far. All the code you write for your application is organized in
bundles. In Symfony2 speak, a bundle is a structured set of files (PHP files,
stylesheets, JavaScripts, images, ...) that implements a single feature (a
blog, a forum, ...) and which can be easily shared with other developers. As
of now, you have manipulated one bundle, AcmeDemoBundle. You will learn
more about bundles in the :doc:`last part of this tutorial</quick_tour/the_architecture>`.

Working with Environments
-------------------------

Now that you have a better understanding of how Symfony2 works, take a closer
look at the bottom of any Symfony2 rendered page. You should notice a small
bar with the Symfony2 logo. This is the "Web Debug Toolbar", and it is a
Symfony2 developer's best friend!

.. image:: /images/quick_tour/web_debug_toolbar.png
   :align: center

But what you see initially is only the tip of the iceberg; click on any of the
bar sections to open the profiler and get much more detailed information about
the request, the query parameters, security details, and database queries:

.. image:: /images/quick_tour/profiler.png
   :align: center

Of course, it would be unwise to have this tool enabled when you deploy your
application, so by default, the profiler is not enabled in the ``prod``
environment.

.. _quick-tour-big-picture-environments-intro:

So what *is* an environment? An :term:`Environment` represents a group of
configuration that's used to run your application. Symfony2 defines by default
two environments: ``dev`` (suited for when developing the application locally)
and ``prod`` (optimized for when executing the application on production).

Typically, the environments share a large amount of configuration options. For
that reason, you put your common configuration in ``config.yml`` and override
where necessary in the specific configuration file for each environment:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config_dev.yml
    imports:
        - { resource: config.yml }

    web_profiler:
        toolbar: true
        intercept_redirects: false

In this example, the ``dev`` environment loads the ``config_dev.yml`` configuration
file, which itself imports the common ``config.yml`` file and then modifies it
by enabling the web debug toolbar.

When you visit the ``app_dev.php`` file in your browser, you're executing
your Symfony application in the ``dev`` environment. To visit your application
in the ``prod`` environment, visit the ``app.php`` file instead.

The demo routes in our application are only available in the ``dev`` environment.
Therefore, if you try to access the ``http://localhost/app.php/demo/hello/Fabien``
URL, you'll get a 404 error.

.. tip::

    If instead of using PHP built-in webserver, you use Apache with ``mod_rewrite``
    enabled and take advantage of the ``.htaccess`` file Symfony2 provides
    in ``web/``, you can even omit the ``app.php`` part of the URL. The default
    ``.htaccess`` points all requests to the ``app.php`` front controller:

    .. code-block:: text

        http://localhost/demo/hello/Fabien

For more details on environments, see ":ref:`Environments & Front Controllers<page-creation-environments>`" article.

Final Thoughts
--------------

Congratulations! You've had your first taste of Symfony2 code. That wasn't so
hard, was it? There's a lot more to explore, but you should already see how
Symfony2 makes it really easy to implement web sites better and faster. If you
