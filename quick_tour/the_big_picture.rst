The Big Picture
===============

Start using Symfony in 10 minutes! This chapter will walk you through the
most important concepts behind Symfony and explain how you can get started
quickly by showing you a simple project in action.

If you've used a web framework before, you should feel right at home with
Symfony. If not, welcome to a whole new way of developing web applications.

Installing Symfony
------------------

Before continuing reading this chapter, make sure to have installed both PHP
and Symfony as explained in the :doc:`installation chapter </book/installation>`
of the Symfony book.

Understanding the Fundamentals
------------------------------

One of the main goals of a framework is to keep your code organized and
to allow your application to evolve easily over time by avoiding the mixing
of database calls, HTML tags and other PHP code in the same script. To achieve
this goal with Symfony, you'll first need to learn a few fundamental concepts.

When developing a Symfony application, your responsibility as a developer
is to write the code that maps the user's *request* (e.g. ``http://localhost:8000/``)
to the *resource* associated with it (the ``Homepage`` HTML page).

The code to execute is defined as methods of PHP classes. The methods are
called **actions** and the classes **controllers**, but in practice most
developers use **controllers** to refer to both of them. The mapping between
user's requests and that code is defined via the **routing** configuration.
And the contents displayed in the browser are usually rendered using
**templates**.

When you go to ``http://localhost:8000/app/example``, Symfony will execut the
controller in ``src/AppBundle/Controller/DefaultController.php`` and rendered
the ``app/Resources/views/default/index.html.twig`` template.
In the following sections you'll learn in detail the inner workings of Symfony
controllers, routes and templates.

Actions and Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the ``src/AppBundle/Controller/DefaultController.php`` file and you'll
see the following code (for now, don't look at the ``@Route`` configuration
because that will be explained in the next section)::

    namespace AppBundle\Controller;

    use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;
    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;

    class DefaultController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * @Route("/", name="homepage")
         */
        public function indexAction()
        {
            return $this->render('default/index.html.twig');
        }
    }

In Symfony applications, **controllers** are usually PHP classes whose names
are suffixed with the ``Controller`` word. In this example, the controller
is called ``Default`` and the PHP class is called ``DefaultController``.

The methods defined in a controller are called **actions**, they are usually
associated with one URL of the application and their names are suffixed
with ``Action``. In this example, the ``Default`` controller has only one
action called ``index`` and defined in the ``indexAction()`` method.

Actions are usually very short - around 10-15 lines of code - because they
just call other parts of the application to get or generate the needed
information and then they render a template to show the results to the user.

In this example, the ``index`` action is practically empty because it doesn't
need to call any other method. The action just renders a template with the
*Homepage.* content.

Routing
~~~~~~~

Symfony routes each request to the action that handles it by matching the
requested URL against the paths configured by the application. Open again
the ``src/AppBundle/Controller/DefaultController.php`` file and take a look
at the three lines of code above the ``indexAction()`` method::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/DefaultController.php
    namespace AppBundle\Controller;

    use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;
    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;

    class DefaultController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * @Route("/", name="homepage")
         */
        public function indexAction()
        {
            return $this->render('default/index.html.twig');
        }
    }

These three lines define the routing configuration via the ``@Route()``
annotation. A **PHP annotation** is a convenient way to configure a method
without having to write regular PHP code. Beware that annotation blocks
start with ``/**``, whereas regular PHP comments start with ``/*``.

The first value of ``@Route()`` defines the URL that will trigger the execution
of the action. As you don't have to add the host of your application to
the URL (e.g. ```http://example.com``), these URLs are always relative and
they are usually called *paths*. In this case, the ``/`` path refers to the
application homepage. The second value of ``@Route()`` (e.g. ``name="homepage"``)
is optional and sets the name of this route. For now this name is not needed,
but later it'll be useful for linking pages.

Considering all this, the ``@Route("/", name="homepage")`` annotation creates a
new route called ``homepage`` which makes Symfony execute the ``index`` action
of the ``Default`` controller when the user browses the ``/`` path of the application.

.. tip::

    In addition to PHP annotations, routes can be configured in YAML, XML
    or PHP files, as explained in
    :doc:`the Routing chapter of the Symfony book </book/routing>`. This
    flexibility is one of the main features of Symfony, a framework that
    never imposes a particular configuration format on you.

Templates
~~~~~~~~~

The only content of the ``index`` action is this PHP instruction::

    return $this->render('default/index.html.twig');

The ``$this->render()`` method is a convenient shortcut to render a template.
Symfony provides some useful shortcuts to any controller extending from
the base Symfony :class:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller`
class.

By default, application templates are stored in the ``app/Resources/views/``
directory. Therefore, the ``default/index.html.twig`` template corresponds
to the ``app/Resources/views/default/index.html.twig``. Open that file and
you'll see the following code:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    {# app/Resources/views/default/index.html.twig #}
    {% extends 'base.html.twig' %}

    {% block body %}
        <h1>Welcome to Symfony</h1>

        {# ... #}
    {% endblock %}

This template is created with `Twig`_, a template engine created for modern PHP
applications. The :doc:`second part of this tutorial </quick_tour/the_view>`
explains how templates work in Symfony.

.. _quick-tour-big-picture-environments:

Working with Environments
-------------------------

Now that you have a better understanding of how Symfony works, take a closer
look at the bottom of any Symfony rendered page. You should notice a small
bar with the Symfony logo. This is the "web debug toolbar" and it is a Symfony
developer's best friend!

.. image:: /images/quick_tour/web_debug_toolbar.png
   :align: center

But what you see initially is only the tip of the iceberg; click on any
of the bar sections to open the profiler and get much more detailed information
about the request, the query parameters, security details and database queries:

.. image:: /images/quick_tour/profiler.png
   :align: center

This tool provides so much internal information about your application that
you may be worried about your visitors accessing sensible information. Symfony
is aware of this issue and for that reason, it won't display this bar when
your application is running in the production server.

How does Symfony know whether your application is running locally or on
a production server? Keep reading to discover the concept of **execution
environments**.

.. _quick-tour-big-picture-environments-intro:

What is an Environment?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An :term:`environment` represents a group of configurations that's used
to run your application. Symfony defines two environments by default: ``dev``
(suited for when developing the application locally) and ``prod`` (optimized
for when executing the application on production).

When you visit the ``http://localhost:8000`` URL in your browser, you're
executing your Symfony application in the ``dev`` environment. To visit
your application in the ``prod`` environment, visit the ``http://localhost:8000/app.php``
URL instead. If you prefer to always show the ``dev`` environment in the
URL, you can visit ``http://localhost:8000/app_dev.php`` URL.

The main difference between environments is that ``dev`` is optimized to
provide lots of information to the developer, which means worse application
performance. Meanwhile, ``prod`` is optimized to get the best performance,
which means that debug information is disabled, as well as the web debug
toolbar.

The other difference between environments is the configuration options used
to execute the application. When you access the ``dev`` environment, Symfony
loads the ``app/config/config_dev.yml`` configuration file. When you access
the ``prod`` environment, Symfony loads ``app/config/config_prod.yml`` file.

Typically, the environments share a large amount of configuration options.
For that reason, you put your common configuration in ``config.yml`` and
override the specific configuration file for each environment where necessary:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config_dev.yml
    imports:
        - { resource: config.yml }

    web_profiler:
        toolbar: true
        intercept_redirects: false

In this example, the ``config_dev.yml`` configuration file imports the common
``config.yml`` file and then overrides any existing web debug toolbar configuration
with its own options.

For more details on environments, see
":ref:`page-creation-environments`" section of the book.

Final Thoughts
--------------

Congratulations! You've had your first taste of Symfony code. That wasn't
so hard, was it? There's a lot more to explore, but you should already see
how Symfony makes it really easy to implement web sites better and faster.
