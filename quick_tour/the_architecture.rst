The Architecture
================

You are my hero! Who would have thought that you would still be here after the
first three parts? Your efforts will be well-rewarded soon. The first three
parts didn't look too deeply at the architecture of the framework. As it makes
Symfony2 stand apart from the framework crowd, let's dive into it now.

Understanding the Directory Structure
-------------------------------------

The directory structure of a Symfony2 :term:`application` is rather flexible
but the directory structure of the *Standard Edition* distribution reflects
the typical and recommended structure of a Symfony2 application:

* ``app/``:    The application configuration;
* ``src/``:    The project's PHP code;
* ``vendor/``: The third-party dependencies;
* ``web/``:    The web root directory.

The Web Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The web root directory is the home of all public and static files like images,
stylesheets, and JavaScript files. It is also where each :term:`front controller`
lives::

    // web/app.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/../app/bootstrap.php';
    require_once __DIR__.'/../app/AppKernel.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    $kernel = new AppKernel('prod', false);
    $kernel->handle(Request::createFromGlobals())->send();

The kernel first requires the ``bootstrap.php`` file, which bootstraps the
framework and registers the autoloader (see below).

Like any front controller, ``app.php`` uses a Kernel Class, ``AppKernel``, to
bootstrap the application.

The Application Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``AppKernel`` class is the main entry point of the application
configuration and as such, it is stored in the ``app/`` directory.

This class must implement two methods:

* ``registerBundles()`` must return an array of all bundles needed to run the
  application;

* ``registerContainerConfiguration()`` loads the application configuration
  (more on this later).

PHP autoloading can be configured via ``app/autoload.php``::

    // app/autoload.php
    use Symfony\Component\ClassLoader\UniversalClassLoader;

    $loader = new UniversalClassLoader();
    $loader->registerNamespaces(array(
        'Symfony'          => array(__DIR__.'/../vendor/symfony/src', __DIR__.'/../vendor/bundles'),
        'Sensio'           => __DIR__.'/../vendor/bundles',
        'JMS'              => __DIR__.'/../vendor/bundles',
        'Doctrine\\Common' => __DIR__.'/../vendor/doctrine-common/lib',
        'Doctrine\\DBAL'   => __DIR__.'/../vendor/doctrine-dbal/lib',
        'Doctrine'         => __DIR__.'/../vendor/doctrine/lib',
        'Zend\\Log'        => __DIR__.'/../vendor/zend-log',
        'Assetic'          => __DIR__.'/../vendor/assetic/src',
        'Acme'             => __DIR__.'/../src',
    ));
    $loader->registerPrefixes(array(
        'Twig_Extensions_' => __DIR__.'/../vendor/twig-extensions/lib',
        'Twig_'            => __DIR__.'/../vendor/twig/lib',
        'Swift_'           => __DIR__.'/../vendor/swiftmailer/lib/classes',
    ));
    $loader->register();

:class:`Symfony\\Component\\ClassLoader\\UniversalClassLoader` is used to
autoload files that respect either the technical interoperability `standards`_
for PHP 5.3 namespaces or the PEAR naming `convention`_ for classes. As you
can see here, all dependencies are stored under the ``vendor/`` directory, but
this is just a convention. You can store them wherever you want, globally on
your server or locally in your projects.

.. note::

    If you want to learn more about the flexibility of the Symfony2
    autoloader, read the "`How to autoload Classes`_" recipe in the cookbook.

Understanding the Bundle System
-------------------------------

This section introduces one of the greatest and most powerful features of
Symfony2, the :term:`bundle` system.

A bundle is kind of like a plugin in other software. So why is it called
*bundle* and not *plugin*? Because *everything* is a bundle in Symfony2, from
the core framework features to the code you write for your application.
Bundles are first-class citizens in Symfony2. This gives you the flexibility
to use pre-built features packaged in third-party bundles or to distribute
your own bundles. It makes it easy to pick and choose which features to enable
in your application and optimize them the way you want.

Registering a Bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An application is made up of bundles as defined in the ``registerBundles()``
method of the ``AppKernel`` class::

    // app/AppKernel.php
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            new Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\FrameworkBundle(),
            new Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\SecurityBundle(),
            new Symfony\Bundle\TwigBundle\TwigBundle(),
            new Symfony\Bundle\ZendBundle\ZendBundle(),
            new Symfony\Bundle\SwiftmailerBundle\SwiftmailerBundle(),
            new Symfony\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\DoctrineBundle(),
            new Symfony\Bundle\AsseticBundle\AsseticBundle(),
            new Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\SensioFrameworkExtraBundle(),
            new JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\JMSSecurityExtraBundle(),
            new Acme\DemoBundle\AcmeDemoBundle(),
        );

        if (in_array($this->getEnvironment(), array('dev', 'test'))) {
            $bundles[] = new Symfony\Bundle\WebProfilerBundle\WebProfilerBundle();
            $bundles[] = new Symfony\Bundle\WebConfiguratorBundle\SymfonyWebConfiguratorBundle();
        }

        return $bundles;
    }

In addition to ``AcmeDemoBundle`` that we have already talked about, notice
that the kernel also enables ``FrameworkBundle``, ``DoctrineBundle``,
``SwiftmailerBundle``, and ``AsseticBundle``. They are all part of the core
framework.

Configuring a Bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each bundle can be customized via configuration files written in YAML, XML, or
PHP. Have a look at the default configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    imports:
        - { resource: parameters.ini }
        - { resource: security.yml }

    framework:
        charset:       UTF-8
        error_handler: null
        csrf_protection:
            enabled: true
            secret: %csrf_secret%
        router:        { resource: "%kernel.root_dir%/config/routing.yml" }
        validation:    { enabled: true, annotations: true }
        templating:    { engines: ['twig'] } #assets_version: SomeVersionScheme
        session:
            default_locale: %locale%
            lifetime:       3600
            auto_start:     true

    # Twig Configuration
    twig:
        debug:            %kernel.debug%
        strict_variables: %kernel.debug%

    # Assetic Configuration
    assetic:
        debug:          %kernel.debug%
        use_controller: false

    # Doctrine Configuration
    doctrine:
        dbal:
            default_connection: default
            connections:
                default:
                    driver:   %database_driver%
                    host:     %database_host%
                    dbname:   %database_name%
                    user:     %database_user%
                    password: %database_password%

        orm:
            auto_generate_proxy_classes: %kernel.debug%
            default_entity_manager: default
            entity_managers:
                default:
                    mappings:
                        AcmeDemoBundle: ~

    # Swiftmailer Configuration
    swiftmailer:
        transport: %mailer_transport%
        host:      %mailer_host%
        username:  %mailer_user%
        password:  %mailer_password%

    jms_security_extra:
        secure_controllers:  true
        secure_all_services: false

Each entry like ``framework`` defines the configuration for a bundle.

Each :term:`environment` can override the default configuration by providing a
specific configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config_dev.yml
    imports:
        - { resource: config.yml }

    framework:
        router:   { resource: "%kernel.root_dir%/config/routing_dev.yml" }
        profiler: { only_exceptions: false }

    web_profiler:
        toolbar: true
        intercept_redirects: false

    zend:
        logger:
            priority: debug
            path:     %kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log

    assetic:
        use_controller: true

Extending a Bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to be a nice way to organize and configure your code, a bundle can
extend another one (bundles support inheritance). It allows you to override
any existing bundle to customize its controllers, templates, and any file it
contains. This is where the logical names come in handy as they abstract where
the resource is actually stored.

For controllers, Symfony2 will automatically choose the right file according
to the bundle inheritance tree.

When you want to reference a file from a bundle, use this notation:
``@BUNDLE_NAME/PATH_TO_FILE``; Symfony2 will expand ``@BUNDLE_NAME`` to the
path to the bundle. For instance, it converts
``@AcmeDemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php`` to
``src/Acme/DemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php``.

For controllers, you need to reference method names:
``BUNDLE_NAME:CONTROLLER_NAME:ACTION_NAME``. For instance,
``AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index`` means the ``indexAction`` method from the
``Acme\DemoBundle\Controller\WelcomeController`` class.

For templates, it is even more interesting as templates do not need to be
stored on the filesystem. You can easily store them in a database table for
instance. For instance, ``AcmeDemoBundle:Welcome:index.html.twig`` is
converted to ``src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/views/Welcome/index.html.twig``.

Do you understand now why Symfony2 is so flexible? Share your bundles between
applications, store them locally or globally, your choice.

Using Vendors
-------------

Odds are that your application will depend on third-party libraries. Those
should be stored in the ``vendor/`` directory. This directory already contains
the Symfony2 libraries, the SwiftMailer library, the Doctrine ORM, the Twig
templating system, and some other third party libraries and bundles.

Understanding the Cache and Logs
--------------------------------

Symfony2 is probably one of the fastest full-stack frameworks around. But how
can it be so fast if it parses and interprets tens of YAML and XML files for
each request? This is partly due to its cache system. The application
configuration is only parsed for the very first request and then compiled down
to plain PHP code stored in the ``app/cache/`` directory. In the development
environment, Symfony2 is smart enough to flush the cache when you change a
file. But in the production environment, it is your responsibility to clear
the cache when you update your code or change its configuration.

When developing a web application, things can go wrong in many ways. The log
files in the ``app/logs/`` directory tell you everything about the requests
and help you fix the problem quickly.

Using the Command Line Interface
--------------------------------

Each application comes with a command line interface tool (``app/console``)
that helps you maintain your application. It provides commands that boost your
productivity by automating tedious and repetitive tasks.

Run it without any arguments to learn more about its capabilities:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console

The ``--help`` option helps you discover the usage of a command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console router:debug --help

Final Thoughts
--------------

Call me crazy, but after reading this part, you should be comfortable with
moving things around and making Symfony2 work for you. Everything is done in
Symfony2 to get out of your way. So, feel free to rename and move directories
around as you see fit.

And that's all for the quick tour. From testing to sending emails, you still
need to learn a lot to become a Symfony2 master. Ready to dig into these
topics now? Look no further - go to the official `book`_ and pick any topic
you want.
