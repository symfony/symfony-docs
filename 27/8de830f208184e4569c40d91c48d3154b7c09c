This was merged - woot! @romainneutron was this merged into master or 2.3? It looked like master, but says `2.3-dev` here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/44735cdd5f6bd3674da06e2924555f3ad80bf4bb

Let's make any last changes to this PR and I'll merge it in.

Thanks!

Woops, I definitely missed your ping @xabbuh! I just added what you all suggested. Just a question, how should I add un unordered list?

Something like?

```
There are three ways to use the process helper:

  - Something like this
    blablabla

  - Something like that
    blablabla
```

@romainneutron You can create [unordered lists](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#bullet-lists) using the ``*`` character:

```rst
There are three ways to use the process helper:

* foo
* bar
```
