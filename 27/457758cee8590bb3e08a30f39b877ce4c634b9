@r1n0x can you find out, since when this is possible? Do you have a PR or is it here since the beginning? IN this case we must target `5.4` branch, but we can handle that for you while merging.

Thanks

@OskarStark As far as I could find, it may be there from the beginnings of Doctrine transport - here's a link https://github.com/symfony/messenger/commit/7234411650555c52f15226faf2e9c22010c5cf85
That would be messenger 4.3
