I like this! The repetition of some constructions in the docs is really annoying some times (e.g. `in order` 103 times, `allows you to` 107 times, `if you want` 171 times, etc.)

Yes, it annoys me too. I wanted to start updating at least some of the sections where phrases like the ones you mentioned aren't necessary to convey the meaning.
