Could you please squash your commits into one? We cannot squash merge it with our tool if there is a merge commit.

Thank you!

@OskarStark the branch name `patch-1` is usually associated with quick edits via gitHub's web interface ... so "squashing" is not possible in a simple way.

I know but how does the merge commit goes in then? üßê

The merge commit is from the built in merge conflict tool of GitHub.

I'm currently on holidays. Will do it when I come back home on august, 1st.
