Wow, it looks like you're right (https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/tutorial/increasing_your_hitrate.html#cache-control).

What do you think about adding a little note in your comment that says that Varnish ignores the `no-cache` by default and include the link from above? I want to leave "breadcrumbs" for readers later when they see this.
