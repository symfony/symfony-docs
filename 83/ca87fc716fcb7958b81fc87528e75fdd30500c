@superhaggis it *looks* like a typo ... but it's not :)

It's a "magic feature" of the format we use to write the docs. If you put `::` in the line before some code block, it's highlighted with the default language you configured (PHP in our case).

So, this `::` magic avoids us to repeat thousands of times this -->

```
.. code-block:: php
```

Of course I understood your Pull Request wrong ... not only you know the `::` trick, but you correctly fixed it. I'm really sorry 😊  🙏  🙇
