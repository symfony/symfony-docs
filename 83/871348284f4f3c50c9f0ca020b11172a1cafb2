Thanks @kix for taking the time to submit this PR, it looks like the root problem has been fixed: phpspec/prophecy#275

I think that this PR can be closed, PHPUnit can be installed on Symfony 3.1 since the new release of Prophecy this morning.

Imo it's still a good idea to recommend not to add PHPUnit to the project's requirements.
