Hi!

I'm sorry, I was wrong for the option `--firewall false`, it does not work as expected.
Since https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/releases/tag/v1.0.2 has been released, I'm now able to play with the dev-server and I faced the `Invalid Host Header`.

However, using `Encore.configureDevServer()` works fine but that's not ideal:
```js
Encore.configureDevServer(option => {
    option.firewall = false;
});
```

What do you think about the last commit @Kocal? I'm showing `options.firewall = false`. That section about CORS had previously mentioned using ``--port`, but that seemed unrelated / unnecessary to me.

That's great üëç

I don't think this will be an issue for not specifying `--port` option, usually VM opens all ports (I've never had to configure this flag).

Ok, should be good again!
