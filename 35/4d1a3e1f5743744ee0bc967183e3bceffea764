Thanks Thomas! However, if I run this command in my app:

```
$ php bin/console config:dump framework http_client
```

I see this:

```
            # Indicates if the peer should be verified in an SSL/TLS context.
            verify_peer:          ~

            # Indicates if the host should exist as a certificate common name.
            verify_host:          ~
```

So, it looks like they are `null` by default ðŸ¤”   In the DI extension, the node is defiend as `booleanNode()` without a default value defined for it.

Hm. When I don't set a value, I'm getting this error on several URL's:

> SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK for "https://www.example.com/".

Then, after setting `'verify_peer' => false`, they're all gone. So I figured that the default must be true ;-) @nicolas-grekas What's the correct answer?
