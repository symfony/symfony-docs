-1 for showing the deprecated way of configuring form themes

I agree with @stof. As of Symfony 2.6, the option `twig.form.resources` was renamed to `twig.form_themes`. This option is shown in the lines above the added lines.

However, I'm +1 for adding the bootstrap to this `twig.form_themes` option. Can you please update your PR?
