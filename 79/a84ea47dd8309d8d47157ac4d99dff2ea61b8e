Hmm, but it should, according to the aliases named here:
https://github.com/symfony/recipes/blob/master/symfony/webpack-encore-bundle/1.0/manifest.json

encore, webpack and webpack-encore

Symfony uses `symfony/flex` to "ease" installation of bundles/integrations into the framework. It's a Composer plugin that you need to include as a dependency in the project if you want to use it.

Once you install it, you can use "package aliases" to install stuff. `encore` is such an alias (all aliases are listed on https://symfony.sh). Besides that, it also adds more great features like recipes (which create some bootstrap code related to packages you install). See https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex.html for more information.

However, to not confuse people not using Flex (like I assume the project you're working on), I think we decided not to use aliases in the documentation. So üëç on this change!

I'm afraid I disagree here. I think that installing the bundle it's not equivalent to running the recipe, because several files and dirs are created too by the recipe.

Also, I don't think the current doc is confusing. It shows two different ways of installing this and the first one continuously mentions "Symfony Flex" and gives you some hints when you are not using that. This is how the doc is designed:

The thing is this IS Symfony 3.4 application (so I'm reading correct doc page I guess), except it is not using flex.
Therefore,  It does not fall into the "non Symfony Applications" category. And this is counterintuitive.
Maybe, in that case, add another section for old-style package installing without flex but still within symfony?
