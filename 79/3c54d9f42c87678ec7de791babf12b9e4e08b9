Thank you for this suggestion @shkkmo. I think you are right with what you suggest. I just think we should maybe not embed it into this paragraph, but add it to its own `caution` block or the like to make it more outstanding and easier to spot. What do you think?

Sure, didn't know where to added it, but it is definitely a gotcha that i
couldn't figure out till u dug into the source code. How do i add a caution
block?

It will look like this:

```rst
.. caution::

    A handler that should log only messages for certain channels must be
    a top-level handler. Handlers nested in filters, groups or other handlers
    will receive every messages regardless of the channel.
```

I think the best place would be just below the configuration block.
