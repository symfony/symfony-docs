thanks. then lets merge - or do we need to wait for input from others?

At least, @weaverryan will have another look at this since he's the only to merge pull requests.

After reading your discussion on FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle#1566, does it make sense to choose another example that is more of a real-world one?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

hm, good point. we do this with CmfRoutingBundle. or i can just do an
AcmeDemoBundle example if you prefer.

I don't mind. If you have an example in the routing bundle, you'll be able to link to it, won't you? That would maybe be more interesting.

@dbu I added a few tiny comments, but I'm happy with this and the example. If you'd like to add a link to a real implementation, I think that's a great idea.

Thanks!

thanks for the feedback. fixed all, and changed the example to CmfRoutingBundle (although its also not a completely real example, as we don't support mongo/couchdb at the moment)
