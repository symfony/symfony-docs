Good job! I left some minor comments but :+1:

Considering I failed English at school, the only language I can speak, thanks!
I'll try to finish this along with the edits within the next couple of days.

Back in Europe, finally have internet access, any comments on this so far? /cc @dunglas.

This looks good to me. Anything more that needs to be done?

The *Creating Your Own Extractors* section could possibly be expanded but I could never figure out how to word it :P

I think that might be next, advanced article.

I'd add just this simple "How to use this" version. It's really missed at the moment.

Hi @zanderbaldwin!

I'm sorry that it took so long before one of us reviewed this PR. I think it's a nice start. Can you please fix the comments I added to this PR and make sure lines are wrapped after the first word that crosses the 72th character (they are a bit too long atm)? Thanks already!

If you don't have time, just comment and we'll continue this PR.

status: needs work

Hi guys, I've made the changes that were suggested. Does anyone have any other input?

Looks good to me. You did a very good job documenting this component, thank you!

@zanderbaldwin can you rebase your PR?

@xabbuh @wouterj @weaverryan can this PR be merged? It would be nice to have the doc for this component online.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by zanderbaldwin at 2016-08-16T11:35:13Z

Rebased, though you might want to check that I've solved all the conflicts correctly...

Got the build working, would you like the 5 commits squashed into 1?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by dunglas at 2016-08-16T12:13:36Z

Commits can be squashed by the merger.
