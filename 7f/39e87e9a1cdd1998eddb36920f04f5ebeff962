I like this one. However, this is all going to change (acmedemobundle will be removed in favor of a symfony demo application and the appbundle will default to /). But I think we should merge this PR soon, to avoid further confusion, and see what's going to happen in the future.

@WouterJ I totally agree with you: merge it ASAP to avoid confusion and let's see what happens in the future.

Is the AcmeDemoBundle going to be removed from the 2.3 branch, too
Sorry, I missed the discussion about this step.
