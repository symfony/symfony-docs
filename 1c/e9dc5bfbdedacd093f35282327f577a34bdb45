I based this on the 2.3 branch as asked, just don’t know where or how I can see that here on GitHub.

@GeertDD when creating the PR, you have a bar at the top which shows you the target branch and the branch of the PR. Hit "edit" and change the target branch to "2.3".

You can't change the target when a PR is already opened. But no worries, our tools can cope with this, it's just a little bit easier if the PR was based on the correct branch immediately.

Okay, I’ll give it a try next time. Thanks, Wouter.
