Thank you @yceruto! I've labelled it as finished, although I'm not sure if it's correct (I don't know much about the logic behind these file upload chapters). So I let other doc maintainers decide whether to merge it or not.

Please also note that this article is likely to be removed soon: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/2346#issuecomment-115739439

I remember that we recently had an issue/pull request were someone requested a similar change. Unfortunately, I cannot find it anymore.

:+1: We really need to facelift the article, but this change should at least fix the issue described in #5448.
