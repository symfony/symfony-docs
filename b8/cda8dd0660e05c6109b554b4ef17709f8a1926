Changed it like @javiereguiluz said.
I only swapped the two RFC duration strings, putting the shorter (and hopefully easier to understand) one in the intro text and the full example in the string input description.
Also fixed the sorting of the options list to match the other type docs.

@MisatoTremor thanks for adding this form type and for providing the docs too. Today we've highlighted it in the Symfony blog (see [New in Symfony 3.2: DateInterval form type](http://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-2-dateinterval-form-type)).

When writing the blog post, I wondered if this type could be a bit easier to use. In particular, I wonder if the `input` option could be removed. If it's only used to tell the form type which format we are using (DateInterval, array or string) I think we can detect the format automatically. Do you think that would be possible? Thanks!

@javiereguiluz Thanks for the nice highlight! :)

I've included the option according to other date/time types, but this indeed sounds like a great improvement. Maybe this could be done for the other types, too. Will look into into

Hi @MisatoTremor! I'm sorry for the long delay, seems like this one slipped under our radar. As 3 doc members already reviewed this and you fixed their comments, I assume this one is ready to merge.
