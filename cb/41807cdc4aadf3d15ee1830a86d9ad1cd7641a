1) You mentioned we should remove this:

But we should keep it, as of now it doesn't match Symfony CS if you use `array()`, and therefore its correct.

I created this PR and added your comments here as questions, because I will target the correct branch in my PR (#11080) and do a rebase, so your comments would get lost
