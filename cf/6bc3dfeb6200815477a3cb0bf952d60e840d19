All issues have been fixed. Can we label this as `finished`? Thanks!

I've updated this PR to add a note comparing listeners and subscribers, as asked in #3987.

Please, tell me what else I can do to get this PR labelled as `finished`. Thanks.

the PR title is weird.

this would be better IMO:
```Added a cookbook SECTION about event subscribers```

I've reworded the introduction and also made the required changes. This is ready for the final review. Thanks!

In http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/bundles/best_practices.html, directory for events listeners is ````EventListener/````, and ````Listener/```` in this PR.
Will be nice to rule on it.

Indeed, can you make that last change, Javier? Then, this is ready to be merged.

I've made some final changes in b5a82ca.

:+1: Thanks Javier. That's a really nice work and I think we are finally finished here. :)
