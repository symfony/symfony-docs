Btw, IMMIC, ELB can be provisoned with specific IP range, if you use VPC.
So following sentence

```
Some reverse proxies (like AWS Elastic Load Balancing) don't have a static IP address or even a range that you can target with the CIDR notation.
```

would be better to be:

```
Some reverse proxies (like AWS Elastic Load Balancing, unless you don't provision it in VPC) don't have a static IP address or even a range that you can target with the CIDR notation.
```
