Feature was added in 5.2 – should the PR be based on that branch even if it is no longer maintained?

@mpdude 5.4 is correct as we do not backport documentation updates into unmaintained branches even if features were introduced back then

I agree to merge this in `5.4` but adding a `versionadded:: 5.2` directive could be helpful. WDYT?
