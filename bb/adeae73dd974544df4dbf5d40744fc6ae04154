Hey!

Haha, I was thinking of doing this exact same thing. =)

But you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.2.

Cheers!

I'm currently going through the `5.1` milestone in the issues and trying to document missing features listed there, that's how I caught it :slightly_smiling_face:

Nice. You are the best!

That is very appreciated and a great way learn about (new) features.

Actually got the idea from you [some months ago](https://twitter.com/TobiasNyholm/status/1314478224286650368) :wink:

And had some time lately to contribute !
