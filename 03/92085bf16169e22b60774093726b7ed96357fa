Thanks for reporting this. The method is not part of the contract interface ... but it's defined by all tpyes of HttpClient responses ðŸ¤”

See https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asymfony+tostream&type=code

I see. I removed `toStream` from this section because I noticed that the `ResponseInterface` contains all the methods mentioned in this section but `toStream`.

*Edit:*
I just made a test project where I installed `symfony/http-client`. Typing `$response->toStream();` gives no autocompletion in the editor + I get this red error-line under `toStream`, however, the code works just fine.

Would it be better to re-formulate the intro in [this section](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html#processing-responses)? or maybe actually add the method to the interface?

Let's ask @nicolas-grekas to see if he can help us decide what to do here. Thanks!

toStream is part of [`StreamableInterface`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.3/src/Symfony/Component/HttpClient/Response/StreamableInterface.php). Can't we mention it instead of removing info that might be useful?

Will update the PR later today to mention this instead of removing `toStream`.
