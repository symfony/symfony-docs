How to Generate Entities from an Existing Database
==================================================

.. caution::

    The ``doctrine:mapping:import`` command used to generate Doctrine entities
    from existing databases was deprecated by Doctrine in 2019 and there's no
    replacement for it.

    Instead, you can use the ``make:entity`` command from `Symfony Maker Bundle`_
    to help you generate the code of your Doctrine entities. This command
    requires manual supervision because it doesn't generate entities from
    existing databases.
