How to Generate Entities from an Existing Database
==================================================

.. caution::

    The ``doctrine:mapping:import`` command used to generate Doctrine entities
    from existing databases was deprecated by Doctrine in 2019 and it is no
    longer recommended to use it.

    Instead, you can use the ``make:entity`` command from `Symfony Maker Bundle`_
    to quickly generate the Doctrine entities of your application.
