Controller
==========

A controller is a PHP callable you create that takes information from the
HTTP request and creates and returns an HTTP response (as a Symfony
``Response`` object). The response could be an HTML page, an XML document,
a serialized JSON array, an image, a redirect, a 404 error or anything else
you can dream up. The controller contains whatever arbitrary logic *your
application* needs to render the content of a page.

See how simple this is by looking at a Symfony controller in action.
This renders a page that prints the famous ``Hello world!``::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    public function helloAction()
    {
        return new Response('Hello world!');
    }

The goal of a controller is always the same: create and return a ``Response``
object. Along the way, it might read information from the request, load a
database resource, send an email, or set information on the user's session.
But in all cases, the controller will eventually return the ``Response`` object
that will be delivered back to the client.

There's no magic and no other requirements to worry about! Here are a few
common examples:

* *Controller A* prepares a ``Response`` object representing the content
  for the homepage of the site.

* *Controller B* reads the ``{slug}`` placeholder from the request to load a
  blog entry from the database and creates a ``Response`` object displaying
  that blog. If the ``{slug}`` can't be found in the database, it creates and
  returns a ``Response`` object with a 404 status code.

* *Controller C* handles the form submission of a contact form. It reads
  the form information from the request, saves the contact information to
  the database and emails the contact information to you. Finally, it creates
  a ``Response`` object that redirects the client's browser to the contact
  form "thank you" page.

Requests, Controller, Response Lifecycle
----------------------------------------

Every request handled by a Symfony project goes through the same simple lifecycle.
The framework takes care of all the repetitive stuff: you just need to write
your custom code in the controller function:

#. Each request executes a single front controller file (e.g. ``app.php`` on production
   or ``app_dev.php`` on development) that bootstraps the application;

#. The front controller's only job is to initialize Symfony's engine (called the
   ``Kernel``) and pass it a ``Request`` object to handle;

#. The Symfony core asks the router to inspect the request;

#. The router matches the incoming URL to a specific route and returns
   information about the route, including the controller that should be
   executed;

#. The correct controller from the matched route is executed and the code
   inside the controller creates and returns the appropriate ``Response``
   object;

#. The HTTP headers and content of the ``Response`` object are sent back
   to the client.

Creating a page is as easy as creating a controller (#5) and making a route
that maps a URL to that controller (#4).

.. note::

    Though similarly named, a "front controller" is different from the PHP
    functions called "controllers" talked about in this chapter. A front
    controller is a short PHP file that lives in your ``web/`` directory
    through which all requests are directed. A typical application will
    have a production front controller (e.g. ``app.php``) and a development
    front controller (e.g. ``app_dev.php``). You'll likely never need to
    edit, view or worry about the front controllers in your application.
    The "controller class" is a convenient way to group several "controllers",
    also called actions, together in one class (e.g. ``updateAction()``,
    ``deleteAction()``, etc). So, a controller is a method inside a controller
    class. They hold your code which creates and returns the appropriate
    ``Response`` object.

.. index::
   single: Controller; Simple example

A Simple Controller
-------------------

While a controller can be any PHP callable (a function, method on an object,
or a ``Closure``), a controller is usually a method inside a controller
class::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/HelloController.php
    namespace AppBundle\Controller;

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    class HelloController
    {
        public function indexAction($name)
        {
            return new Response('<html><body>Hello '.$name.'!</body></html>');
        }
    }

The controller is the ``indexAction()`` method, which lives inside a
controller class ``HelloController``.

This controller is pretty straightforward:

* *line 2*: Symfony takes advantage of PHP's namespace functionality to
  namespace the entire controller class.

* *line 4*: Symfony again takes advantage of PHP's namespace functionality:
  the ``use`` keyword imports the ``Response`` class, which the controller
  must return.

* *line 6*: The class name is the concatenation of a name for the controller
  class (i.e. ``Hello``) and the word ``Controller``. This is a convention
  that provides consistency to controllers and allows them to be referenced
  only by the first part of the name (i.e. ``Hello``) in the routing
  configuration.

* *line 8*: Each action in a controller class is suffixed with ``Action``
  and is referenced in the routing configuration by the action's name (e.g. ``index``).
  In the next section, you'll create a route that maps a URI to this action.
  You'll learn how the route's placeholders (``{name}``) become arguments
  to the controller method (``$name``).

* *line 10*: The controller creates and returns a ``Response`` object.

   single: Controller; Routes and controllers

Mapping a URL to a Controller
-----------------------------

The new controller returns a simple HTML page. To actually view this page
in your browser, you need to create a route, which maps a specific URL path
to the controller:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php-annotations

        // src/AppBundle/Controller/HelloController.php
        namespace AppBundle\Controller;

        use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
        use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;

        class HelloController
        {
            /**
             * @Route("/hello/{name}", name="hello")
             */
            public function indexAction($name)
            {
                return new Response('<html><body>Hello '.$name.'!</body></html>');
            }
        }

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/routing.yml
        hello:
            path:      /hello/{name}
            # uses a special syntax to point to the controller - see note below
            defaults:  { _controller: AppBundle:Hello:index }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/routing.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <routes xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/routing"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/routing
                http://symfony.com/schema/routing/routing-1.0.xsd">

            <route id="hello" path="/hello/{name}">
                <!-- uses a special syntax to point to the controller - see note below -->
                <default key="_controller">AppBundle:Hello:index</default>
            </route>
        </routes>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/routing.php
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\Route;
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection;

        $collection = new RouteCollection();
        $collection->add('hello', new Route('/hello/{name}', array(
            // uses a special syntax to point to the controller - see note below
            '_controller' => 'AppBundle:Hello:index',
        )));

        return $collection;

Now, you can go to ``/hello/ryan`` (e.g. ``http://localhost:8000/hello/ryan``
if you're using the :doc:`built-in web server </cookbook/web_server/built_in>`)
and Symfony will execute the ``HelloController::indexAction()`` controller
and pass in ``ryan`` for the ``$name`` variable. Creating a "page" means
simply creating a controller method and an associated route.

Simple, right?

.. sidebar:: The AppBundle:Hello:index controller syntax

    If you use the YAML or XML formats, you'll refer to the controller
    using a special shortcut syntax called the *logical controller name*
    which, for example, looks like ``AppBundle:Hello:index``. For more
    details on the controller format, read
    :ref:`controller-string-syntax` subtitle of the Routing chapter.

.. index::
   single: Controller; Controller arguments

.. _route-parameters-controller-arguments:

Route Parameters as Controller Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You already know that the route points to the
``HelloController::indexAction()`` controller method that lives inside AppBundle.
What's more interesting is the argument that is passed to that controller
method::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/HelloController.php
    // ...
    use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;

    /**
     * @Route("/hello/{name}", name="hello")
     */
    public function indexAction($name)
    {
        // ...
    }

The controller has a single argument, ``$name``, which corresponds to the
``{name}`` placeholder from the matched route (e.g. ``ryan`` if you go to
``/hello/ryan``). When executing the controller, Symfony matches each argument
with a placeholder from the route. So the value for ``{name}`` is passed
to ``$name``. Just make sure they the name of the placeholder is the
same as the name of the argument variable.

Take the following more-interesting example, where the controller has two
arguments::

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php-annotations

        // src/AppBundle/Controller/HelloController.php
        // ...

        use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;

        class HelloController
        {
            /**
             * @Route("/hello/{firstName}/{lastName}", name="hello")
             */
            public function indexAction($firstName, $lastName)
            {
                // ...
            }
        }

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/routing.yml
        hello:
            path:      /hello/{firstName}/{lastName}
            defaults:  { _controller: AppBundle:Hello:index }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/routing.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <routes xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/routing"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/routing
                http://symfony.com/schema/routing/routing-1.0.xsd">

            <route id="hello" path="/hello/{firstName}/{lastName}">
                <default key="_controller">AppBundle:Hello:index</default>
            </route>
        </routes>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/routing.php
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\Route;
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection;

        $collection = new RouteCollection();
        $collection->add('hello', new Route('/hello/{firstName}/{lastName}', array(
            '_controller' => 'AppBundle:Hello:index',
        )));

        return $collection;

Mapping route parameters to controller arguments is easy and flexible.
Keep the following guidelines in mind while you develop.

#. **The order of the controller arguments does not matter**

    Symfony matches the parameter **names** from the route to the variable
    **names** of the controller. The arguments of the controller could be
    totally reordered and still work perfectly::

        public function indexAction($lastName, $firstName)
        {
            // ...
        }

#. **Each required controller argument must match up with a routing parameter**

    The following would throw a ``RuntimeException`` because there is no
    ``foo`` parameter defined in the route::

        public function indexAction($firstName, $lastName, $foo)
        {
            // ...
        }

    Making the argument optional, however, is perfectly ok. The following
    example would not throw an exception::

        public function indexAction($firstName, $lastName, $foo = 'bar')
        {
            // ...
        }

#. **Not all routing parameters need to be arguments on your controller**

    If, for example, the ``lastName`` weren't important for your controller,
    you could omit it entirely::

        public function indexAction($firstName)
        {
            // ...
        }

.. tip::

    You can also pass other variables from your route to your controller
    arguments. See :doc:`/cookbook/routing/extra_information`.


.. index::
   single: Controller; Base controller class

The Base Controller Class
-------------------------

For convenience, Symfony comes with an optional base
:class:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller` class.
If you extend it, this won't change anything about how your controller
works, but you'll get access to a number of **helper methods** and the
**service container** (see :ref:`controller-accessing-services`): an
array-like object that gives you access to every useful object in the
system. These useful objects are called **services**, and Symfony ships
with a service object that can render Twig templates, another that can
log messages and many more.

Add the ``use`` statement atop the ``Controller`` class and then modify
``HelloController`` to extend it::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/HelloController.php
    namespace AppBundle\Controller;

    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;

    class HelloController extends Controller
    {
        // ...
    }

Helper methods are just shortcuts to using core Symfony functionality
that's available to you with or without the use of the base
``Controller`` class. A great way to see the core functionality in
action is to look in the
:class:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller` class.

.. seealso::

    If you're curious about how a controller would work that did *not*
    extend this base ``Controller`` class, check out cookbook article
    :doc:`Controllers as Services </cookbook/controller/service>`.
    This is optional, but can give you more control over the exact
    objects/dependencies that are injected into your controller.

.. index::
   single: Controller; Redirecting

Generating URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :method:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller::generateUrl`
method is just a helper method that generates the URL for a given route.

.. _book-redirecting-users-browser:

Redirecting
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to redirect the user to another page, use the ``redirectToRoute()`` method::

    public function indexAction()
    {
        return $this->redirectToRoute('homepage');

        // redirectToRoute is equivalent to using redirect() and generateUrl() together:
        // return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('homepage'));
    }

.. versionadded:: 2.6
    The ``redirectToRoute()`` method was introduced in Symfony 2.6. Previously (and still now), you
    could use ``redirect()`` and ``generateUrl()`` together for this (see the example above).

By default, the ``redirectToRoute()`` method performs a 302 (temporary) redirect. To
perform a 301 (permanent) redirect, modify the third argument::

    public function indexAction()
    {
        return $this->redirectToRoute('homepage', array(), 301);
    }

To redirect to an *external* site, use ``redirect()`` and pass it the external URL::

    public function indexAction()
    {
        return $this->redirect('http://symfony.com/doc');
    }

For more information, see the :doc:`Routing chapter </book/routing>`.

.. tip::

    The ``redirectToRoute()`` method is simply a shortcut that creates a
    ``Response`` object that specializes in redirecting the user. It's
    equivalent to::

        use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RedirectResponse;

        public function indexAction()
        {
            return new RedirectResponse($this->generateUrl('homepage'));
        }

.. index::
   single: Controller; Rendering templates

.. _controller-rendering-templates:

Rendering Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're serving HTML, you'll want to render a template. The ``render()``
method renders a template **and** puts that content into a ``Response``
object for you::

    // renders app/Resources/views/hello/index.html.twig
    return $this->render('hello/index.html.twig', array('name' => $name));

Templates can also live in deeper sub-directories. Just try to avoid
creating unnecessarily deep structures::

    // renders app/Resources/views/hello/greetings/index.html.twig
    return $this->render('hello/greetings/index.html.twig', array(
        'name' => $name
    ));

Templates are a generic way to render content in *any* format. And while in
most cases you'll use templates to render HTML content, a template can just
as easily generate JavaScript, CSS, XML or any other format you can dream of.
To learn how to render different templating formats read the :ref:`template-formats`
section of the Creating and Using Templates chapter.

The Symfony templating engine is explained in great detail in the
:doc:`Creating and Using Templates chapter </book/templating>`.

.. sidebar:: Templating Naming Pattern

    You can also put templates in the ``Resources/views`` directory of a bundle and
    reference them with a special shortcut syntax like ``@AppBundle/Hello/index.html.twig``
    or ``@AppBundle/layout.html.twig``. These would live in at ``Resources/views/Hello/index.html.twig``
    and ``Resources/views/layout.html.twig`` inside the bundle respectively.

.. index::
   single: Controller; Accessing services

.. _controller-accessing-services:

Accessing other Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symfony comes packed with a lot of useful objects, called services. These
are used for rendering templates, sending emails, querying the database and
any other "work" you can think of. When you install a new bundle, it probably
brings in even *more* services.

When extending the base controller class, you can access any Symfony service
via the :method:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller::get`
method of the ``Controller`` class. Here are several common services you might
need::

    $templating = $this->get('templating');

    $router = $this->get('router');

    $mailer = $this->get('mailer');

What other services exist? To list all services, use the ``debug:container``
console command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console debug:container

For more information, see the :doc:`/book/service_container` chapter.

.. index::
   single: Controller; Managing errors
   single: Controller; 404 pages

Managing Errors and 404 Pages
-----------------------------

When things are not found, you should play well with the HTTP protocol and
return a 404 response. To do this, you'll throw a special type of exception.
If you're extending the base ``Controller`` class, do the following::

    public function indexAction()
    {
        // retrieve the object from database
        $product = ...;
        if (!$product) {
            throw $this->createNotFoundException('The product does not exist');
        }

        return $this->render(...);
    }

The :method:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller::createNotFoundException`
method is just a shortcut to create a special
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Exception\\NotFoundHttpException`
object, which ultimately triggers a 404 HTTP response inside Symfony.

Of course, you're free to throw any ``Exception`` class in your controller -
Symfony will automatically return a 500 HTTP response code.

.. code-block:: php

    throw new \Exception('Something went wrong!');

In every case, an error page is shown to the end user and a full debug
error page is shown to the developer (i.e. when you're using the ``app_dev.php``
front controller - see :ref:`page-creation-environments`).

You'll want to customize the error page your user sees. To do that, see
the ":doc:`/cookbook/controller/error_pages`" cookbook recipe.

.. index::
   single: Controller; The session
   single: Session

.. _book-controller-request-argument:

The Request object as a Controller Argument
-------------------------------------------

What if you need to read query parameters, grab a request header or get access
to an uploaded file? All of that information is stored in Symfony's ``Request``
object. To get it in your controller, just add it as an argument and
**type-hint it with the ``Request`` class**::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    public function indexAction($firstName, $lastName, Request $request)
    {
        $page = $request->query->get('page', 1);

        // ...
    }

Managing the Session
--------------------

Symfony provides a nice session object that you can use to store information
about the user (be it a real person using a browser, a bot, or a web service)
between requests. By default, Symfony stores the attributes in a cookie
by using the native PHP sessions.

To retrieve the session, call
:method:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller::getSession`
method on the ``Request`` object. This method returns a
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Session\\SessionInterface` with easy
methods for storing and fetching things from the session::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    public function indexAction(Request $request)
    {
        $session = $request->getSession();

        // store an attribute for reuse during a later user request
        $session->set('foo', 'bar');

        // get the attribute set by another controller in another request
        $foobar = $session->get('foobar');

        // use a default value if the attribute doesn't exist
        $filters = $session->get('filters', array());
    }

Stored attributes remain in the session for the remainder of that user's session.

.. index::
   single: Session; Flash messages

Flash Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also store special messages, called "flash" messages, on the user's
session. By design, flash messages are meant to be used exactly once: they vanish
from the session automatically as soon as you retrieve them. This feature makes
"flash" messages particularly great for storing user notifications.

For example, imagine you're processing a form submission::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    public function updateAction(Request $request)
    {
        $form = $this->createForm(...);

        $form->handleRequest($request);

        if ($form->isValid()) {
            // do some sort of processing

            $this->addFlash(
                'notice',
                'Your changes were saved!'
            );

            // $this->addFlash is equivalent to $this->get('session')->getFlashBag()->add

            return $this->redirectToRoute(...);
        }

        return $this->render(...);
    }

After processing the request, the controller sets a flash message in the session
and then redirects. The message key (``notice`` in this example) can be anything:
you'll use this key to retrieve the message.

In the template of the next page (or even better, in your base layout template),
read any flash messages from the session:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+twig

        {% for flash_message in app.session.flashbag.get('notice') %}
            <div class="flash-notice">
                {{ flash_message }}
            </div>
        {% endfor %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['session']->getFlash('notice') as $message): ?>
            <div class="flash-notice">
                <?php echo "<div class='flash-error'>$message</div>" ?>
            </div>
        <?php endforeach ?>

.. note::

    It's common to use ``notice``, ``warning`` and ``error`` as the keys of the
    different types of flash messages, but you can use any key that fits your
    needs.

.. tip::

    You can use the
    :method:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Session\\Flash\\FlashBagInterface::peek`
    method instead to retrieve the message while keeping it in the bag.

.. index::
   single: Controller; Response object

The Request and Response Object
-------------------------------

As mentioned :ref:`earlier <book-controller-request-argument>`, the framework will
pass the ``Request`` object to any controller argument that is type-hinted with
the ``Request`` class::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    public function indexAction(Request $request)
    {
        $request->isXmlHttpRequest(); // is it an Ajax request?

        $request->getPreferredLanguage(array('en', 'fr'));

        // retrieve GET and POST variables respectively
        $request->query->get('page');
        $request->request->get('page');

        // retrieve SERVER variables
        $request->server->get('HTTP_HOST');

        // retrieves an instance of UploadedFile identified by foo
        $request->files->get('foo');

        // retrieve a COOKIE value
        $request->cookies->get('PHPSESSID');

        // retrieve an HTTP request header, with normalized, lowercase keys
        $request->headers->get('host');
        $request->headers->get('content_type');
    }

The ``Request`` class has several public properties and methods that return any
information you need about the request.

Like the ``Request``, the ``Response`` object has also a public ``headers`` property.
This is a :class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\ResponseHeaderBag` that has
some nice methods for getting and setting response headers. The header names are
normalized so that using ``Content-Type`` is equivalent to ``content-type`` or even
``content_type``.

The only requirement for a controller is to return a ``Response`` object.
The :class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Response` class is an
abstraction around the HTTP response - the text-based message filled with
headers and content that's sent back to the client::

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    // create a simple Response with a 200 status code (the default)
    $response = new Response('Hello '.$name, Response::HTTP_OK);

    // create a JSON-response with a 200 status code
    $response = new Response(json_encode(array('name' => $name)));
    $response->headers->set('Content-Type', 'application/json');

There are also special classes to make certain kinds of responses easier:

* For JSON, there is :class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\JsonResponse`.
  See :ref:`component-http-foundation-json-response`.

* For files, there is :class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\BinaryFileResponse`.
  See :ref:`component-http-foundation-serving-files`.

* For streamed responses, there is
  :class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\StreamedResponse`.
  See :ref:`streaming-response`.

    Now that you know the basics you can continue your research on Symfony
    ``Request`` and ``Response`` object in the
    :ref:`HttpFoundation component documentation <component-http-foundation-request>`.

Creating Static Pages
---------------------

You can create a static page without even creating a controller (only a route
and template are needed). See cookbook article
:doc:`/cookbook/templating/render_without_controller`.

.. index::
   single: Controller; Forwarding

Forwarding to Another Controller
--------------------------------

Though not very common, you can also forward to another controller
internally with the :method:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller::forward`
method. Instead of redirecting the user's browser, this makes an "internal" sub-request
and calls the defined controller. The ``forward()`` method returns the ``Response``
object that's returned from *that* controller::

    public function indexAction($name)
    {
        $response = $this->forward('AppBundle:Something:fancy', array(
            'name'  => $name,
            'color' => 'green',
        ));

        // ... further modify the response or return it directly

        return $response;
    }

The array passed to the method becomes the arguments for the resulting controller.
The target controller method might look something like this::

    public function fancyAction($name, $color)
    {
        // ... create and return a Response object
    }

Just like when creating a controller for a route, the order of the arguments of
``fancyAction()`` doesn't matter: the matching is done by name.

Validating a CSRF Token
-----------------------

Sometimes, you want to use CSRF protection in an action where you don't want to
use the Symfony Form component. If, for example, you're doing a DELETE action,
you can use the :method:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller::isCsrfTokenValid`
method to check the CSRF token::

    if ($this->isCsrfTokenValid('token_id', $submittedToken)) {
        // ... do something, like deleting an object
    }

    // isCsrfTokenValid() is equivalent to:
    // $this->get('security.csrf.token_manager')->isTokenValid(
    //     new \Symfony\Component\Security\Csrf\CsrfToken\CsrfToken('token_id', $token)
    // );

Final Thoughts
--------------

Whenever you create a page, you'll ultimately need to write some code that
contains the logic for that page. In Symfony, this is called a controller,
and it's a PHP function where you can do anything in order to return the
final ``Response`` object that will be returned to the user.

To make life easier, you can choose to extend a base ``Controller`` class,
which contains shortcut methods for many common controller tasks. For example,
since you don't want to put HTML code in your controller, you can use
the ``render()`` method to render and return the content from a template.

In other chapters, you'll see how the controller can be used to persist and
fetch objects from a database, process form submissions, handle caching and
more.
