Create your First Page in Symfony
=================================

Creating a new page - whether it's an HTML page or a JSON endpoint - is a
simple two-step process:

#. *Create a route*: A route is the URL (e.g. ``/about``) to your page and
   points to a controller;

#. *Create a controller*: A controller is the function you write that builds
   the page. You take the incoming request information and use it to create
   a Symfony ``Response`` object, which can hold HTML content, a JSON string
   or anything else.

Just like on the web, every interaction is initiated by an HTTP request.
Your job is pure and simple: understand that request and return a response.

Creating a Page: Route and Controller
-------------------------------------

.. tip::

    Before continuing, make sure you've read the :doc:`Installation </book/installation>`
    chapter and can access your new Symfony app in the browser.

Suppose you want to create a page - ``/lucky/number`` - that generates a
lucky (well, random) number and prints it. To do that, create a class and
a method inside of it that will be executed when someone goes to ``/lucky/number``::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/LuckyController.php
    namespace AppBundle\Controller;

    use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    class LuckyController
    {
        /**
         * @Route("/lucky/number")
         */
        public function numberAction()
        {
            $number = rand(0, 100);

            return new Response(
                '<html><body>Lucky number: '.$number.'</body></html>'
            );
        }
    }

Before diving into this, test it out!

    http://localhost:8000/lucky/number

.. tip::

    If you set up a proper virtual host in
    :doc:`Apache or Nginx </cookbook/configuration/web_server_configuration>`,
    replace ``http://localhost:8000`` with your host name - like
    ``http://symfony.dev/app_dev.php/lucky/number``.

If you see a lucky number being printed back to you, congratulations! But
before you run off to play the lottery, check out how this works.

The ``@Route`` above ``numberAction()`` is called an *annotation* and it
defines the URL pattern. You can also write routes in YAML (or other formats):
read about this in the :doc:`routing </book/routing>` chapter. Actually, most
routing examples in the docs have tabs that show you how each format looks.

The method below the annotation - ``numberAction`` - is called the *controller*
and is where you build the page. The only rule is that a controller *must*
return a Symfony :ref:`Response <component-http-foundation-response>` object
(and you'll even learn to bend this rule eventually).

Creating a JSON Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Response`` object you return in your controller can contain HTML, JSON
or even a binary file like an image or PDF. You can easily set HTTP headers
or the status code.

Suppose you want to create a JSON endpoint that returns the lucky number.
Just add a second method to ``LuckyController``::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/LuckyController.php

    // ...
    class LuckyController
    {
        // ...

        /**
         * @Route("/api/lucky/number")
         */
        public function apiNumberAction()
        {
            $data = array(
                'lucky_number' => rand(0, 100),
            );

            return new Response(
                json_encode($data),
                200,
                array('Content-Type' => 'application/json')
            );
        }
    }

Try this out in your browser:

    http://localhost:8000/api/lucky/number

You can even shorten this with the handy :class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\JsonResponse`::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/LuckyController.php

    // ...
    // --> don't forget this new use statement
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;

    class LuckyController
    {
        // ...

        /**
         * @Route("/api/lucky/number")
         */
        public function apiNumberAction()
        {
            $data = array(
                'lucky_number' => rand(0, 100),
            );

            // calls json_encode and sets the Content-Type header
            return new JsonResponse($data);
        }
    }

Dynamic URL Patterns: /lucky/number/{count}
-------------------------------------------

Woh, you're doing great! But Symfony's routing can do a lot more. Suppose
now that you want a user to be able to go to ``/lucky/number/5`` to generate
*5* lucky numbers at once. Update the route to have a ``{wildcard}`` part
at the end:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php-annotations

        // src/AppBundle/Controller/LuckyController.php

        // ...
        class LuckyController
        {
            /**
             * @Route("/lucky/number/{count}")
             */
            public function numberAction()
            {
                // ...
            }

            // ...
        }

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/routing.yml
        lucky_number:
            path:     /lucky/number/{count}
            defaults: { _controller: AppBundle:Lucky:number }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/routing.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <routes xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/routing"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/routing
                http://symfony.com/schema/routing/routing-1.0.xsd">

            <route id="lucky_number" path="/lucky/number/{count}">
                <default key="_controller">AppBundle:Lucky:number</default>
            </route>
        </routes>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/routing.php
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection;
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\Route;

        $collection = new RouteCollection();
        $collection->add('lucky_number', new Route('/lucky/number/{count}', array(
            '_controller' => 'AppBundle:Lucky:number',
        )));

        return $collection;

Because of the ``{count}`` "placeholder", the URL to the page is *different*:
it now works for URLs matching ``/lucky/number/*`` - for example ``/lucky/number/5``.
The best part is that you can access this value and use it in your controller::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/LuckyController.php
    // ...

    class LuckyController
    {

        /**
         * @Route("/lucky/number/{count}")
         */
        public function numberAction($count)
        {
            $numbers = array();
            for ($i = 0; $i < $count; $i++) {
                $numbers[] = rand(0, 100);
            }
            $numbersList = implode(', ', $numbers);

            return new Response(
                '<html><body>Lucky numbers: '.$numbersList.'</body></html>'
            );
        }

        // ...
    }

Try it by going to ``/lucky/number/XX`` - replacing XX with *any* number:

    http://localhost:8000/lucky/number/7

You should see *7* lucky numbers printed out! You can get the value of any
``{placeholder}`` in your route by adding a ``$placeholder`` argument to
your controller. Just make sure they have the same name.

The routing system can do a *lot* more, like supporting multiple placeholders
(e.g. ``/blog/{category}/{page})``), making placeholders optional and forcing
placeholder to match a regular expression (e.g. so that ``{count}`` *must*
be a number).

Find out about all of this and become a routing expert in the
:doc:`Routing </book/routing>` chapter.

Rendering a Template (with the Service Container)
-------------------------------------------------

If you're returning HTML from your controller, you'll probably want to render
a template. Fortunately, Symfony comes with Twig: a templating language that's
easy, powerful and actually quite fun.

So far, ``LuckyController`` doesn't extend any base class. The easiest way
to use Twig - or many other tools in Symfony - is to extend Symfony's base
:class:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller` class::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/LuckyController.php

    // ...
    // --> add this new use statement
    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;

    class LuckyController extends Controller
    {
        // ...
    }

Using the ``templating`` Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This doesn't change anything, but it *does* give you access to Symfony's
:doc:`container </book/service_container>`: an array-like object that gives
you access to *every* useful object in the system. These useful objects are
called *services*, and Symfony ships with a service object that can render
Twig templates, another that can log messages and many more.

To render a Twig template, use a service called ``templating``::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/LuckyController.php

    // ...
    class LuckyController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * @Route("/lucky/number/{count}")
         */
        public function numberAction($count)
        {
            // ...
            $numbersList = implode(', ', $numbers);

            $html = $this->container->get('templating')->render(
                'lucky/number.html.twig',
                array('luckyNumberList' => $numbersList)
            );

            return new Response($html);
        }

        // ...
    }

You'll learn a lot more about the important "service container" as you keep
reading. For now, you just need to know that it holds a lot of objects, and
you can ``get()`` any object by using its nickname, like ``templating`` or
``logger``. The ``templating`` service is an instance of :class:`Symfony\\Bundle\\TwigBundle\\TwigEngine`
and this has a ``render()`` method.

But this can get even easier! By extending the ``Controller`` class, you
also get a lot of shortcut methods, like ``render()``::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/LuckyController.php

    // ...
    /**
     * @Route("/lucky/number/{count}")
     */
    public function numberAction($count)
    {
        // ...

        /*
        $html = $this->container->get('templating')->render(
            'lucky/number.html.twig',
            array('luckyNumberList' => $numbersList)
        );

        return new Response($html);
        */

        // render: a shortcut that does the same as above
        return $this->render(
            'lucky/number.html.twig',
            array('luckyNumberList' => $numbersList)
        );
    }

Learn more about these shortcut methods and how they work in the
:doc:`Controller </book/controller>` chapter.

.. tip::

    For more advanced users, you can also
    :doc:`register your controllers as services </cookbook/controller/service>`.

Create the Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you refresh now, you'll get an error:

    Unable to find template "lucky/number.html.twig"

Fix that by creating a new ``app/Resources/views/lucky`` directory and putting
a ``number.html.twig`` file inside of it:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: twig

        {# app/Resources/views/lucky/number.html.twig #}
        {% extends 'base.html.twig' %}

        {% block body %}
            <h1>Lucky Numbers: {{ luckyNumberList }}</h1>
        {% endblock %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <!-- app/Resources/views/lucky/number.html.php -->
        <?php $view->extend('base.html.php') ?>

        <?php $view['slots']->start('body') ?>
            <h1>Lucky Numbers: <?php echo $view->escape($luckyNumberList) ?>
        <?php $view['slots']->stop() ?>

Welcome to Twig! This simple file already shows off the basics: like how
the ``{{ variableName }}`` syntax is used to print something. The ``luckyNumberList``
is a variable that you're passing into the template from the ``render`` call
in your controller.

The ``{% extends 'base.html.twig' %}`` points to a layout file that lives
at `app/Resources/views/base.html.twig`_ and came with your new project.
It's *really* basic (an unstyled HTML structure) and it's yours to customize.
The ``{% block body %}`` part uses Twig's :ref:`inheritance system <twig-inheritance>`
to put the content into the middle of the ``base.html.twig`` layout.

Refresh to see your template in action!

    http://localhost:8000/lucky/number/9

If you view the source code, you now have a basic HTML structure thanks to
``base.html.twig``.

This is just the surface of Twig's power. When you're ready to master its
syntax, loop over arrays, render other templates and other cool things, read
the :doc:`Templating </book/templating>` chapter.

Exploring the Project
---------------------

You've already created a flexible URL, rendered a template that uses inheritance
and created a JSON endpoint. Nice!

It's time to explore and demystify the files in your project. You've already
worked inside the two most important directories:

``app/``
    Contains things like configuration and templates. Basically, anything
    that is *not* PHP code goes here.

``src/``
    Your PHP code lives here.

99% of the time, you'll be working in ``src/`` (PHP files) or ``app/`` (everything
else). As you get more advanced, you'll learn what can be done inside each
of these.

The ``app/`` directory also holds some other things, like ``app/AppKernel.php``,
which you'll use to enable new bundles (this is one of a *very* short list of
PHP files in ``app/``).

The ``src/`` directory has just one directory - ``src/AppBundle`` -
and everything lives inside of it. A bundle is like a "plugin" and you can
`find open source bundles`_ and install them into your project. But even
*your* code lives in a bundle - typically *AppBundle* (though there's
nothing special about AppBundle). To find out more about bundles and
why you might create multiple bundles (hint: sharing code between projects),
see the :doc:`Bundles </book/bundles>` chapter.

So what about the other directories in the project?

``web/``
    This is the document root for the project and contains any publicly accessible
    files, like CSS, images and the Symfony front controllers that execute
    the app (``app_dev.php`` and ``app.php``).

``tests/``
    The automatic tests (e.g. Unit tests) of your application live here.

``bin/``
    The "binary" files live here. The most important one is the ``console``
    file which is used to execute Symfony commands via the console.

``var/``
    This is where automatically created files are stored, like cache files
    (``var/cache/``) and logs (``var/logs/``).

``vendor/``
    Third-party libraries, packages and bundles are downloaded here by
    the `Composer`_ package manager. You should never edit something in this
    directory.

.. seealso::

    Symfony is flexible. If you need to, you can easily override the default
    directory structure. See :doc:`/cookbook/configuration/override_dir_structure`.

Application Configuration
-------------------------

Symfony comes with several built-in bundles (open your ``app/AppKernel.php``
file) and you'll probably install more. The main configuration file for bundles
is ``app/config/config.yml``:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml

        # ...
        framework:
            secret: '%secret%'
            router:
                resource: '%kernel.root_dir%/config/routing.yml'
            # ...

        twig:
            debug:            '%kernel.debug%'
            strict_variables: '%kernel.debug%'

        # ...

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:framework="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony"
            xmlns:twig="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/twig"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony/symfony-1.0.xsd
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/twig
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/twig/twig-1.0.xsd">

            <!-- ... -->

            <framework:config secret="%secret%">
                <framework:router resource="%kernel.root_dir%/config/routing.xml" />
                <!-- ... -->
            </framework:config>

            <!-- Twig Configuration -->
            <twig:config debug="%kernel.debug%" strict-variables="%kernel.debug%" />

            <!-- ... -->
        </container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config.php
        // ...

        $container->loadFromExtension('framework', array(
            'secret' => '%secret%',
            'router' => array(
                'resource' => '%kernel.root_dir%/config/routing.php',
            ),
            // ...
        ));

        // Twig Configuration
        $container->loadFromExtension('twig', array(
            'debug'            => '%kernel.debug%',
            'strict_variables' => '%kernel.debug%',
        ));

        // ...

The ``framework`` key configures FrameworkBundle, the ``twig`` key configures
TwigBundle and so on. A *lot* of behavior in Symfony can be controlled just
by changing one option in this configuration file. To find out how, see the
:doc:`Configuration Reference </reference/index>` section.

Or, to get a big example dump of all of the valid configuration under a key,
use the handy ``bin/console`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console config:dump-reference framework

There's a lot more power behind Symfony's configuration system, including
environments, imports and parameters. To learn all of it, see the
:doc:`Configuration </book/configuration>` chapter.

What's Next?
------------

Congrats! You're already starting to master Symfony and learn a whole new
way of building beautiful, functional, fast and maintainable apps.

Ok, time to finish mastering the fundamentals by reading these chapters:

* :doc:`/book/controller`
* :doc:`/book/routing`
* :doc:`/book/templating`

Then, in the :doc:`Symfony Book </book/index>`, learn about the :doc:`service container </book/service_container>`,
the :doc:`form system </book/forms>`, using :doc:`Doctrine </book/doctrine>`
(if you need to query a database) and more!

There's also a :doc:`Cookbook </cookbook/index>` *packed* with more advanced
"how to" articles to solve *a lot* of problems.

Have fun!
