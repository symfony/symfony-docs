Security
========

Security is a two-step process whose goal is to prevent a user from accessing
a resource that he/she should not have access to.

In the first step of the process, the security system identifies who the user
is by requiring the user to submit some sort of identification. This is called
**authentication**, and it means that the system is trying to find out who
you are.

Once the system knows who you are, the next step is to determine if you should
have access to a given resource. This part of the process is called **authorization**,
and it means that the system is checking to see if you have privileges to
perform a certain action.

Since the best way to learn is to see an example, let's dive right in.

.. note::

    Symfony's `security component`_ is available as a standalone PHP library
    for use inside any PHP project.

Basic Example: HTTP Authentication
----------------------------------

The security component can be configured via your application configuration.
In fact, most standard security setups are just a matter of using the right
configuration. The following configuration tells Symfony to secure any URL
matching ``/admin/*`` and to ask the user for credentials using basic HTTP
authentication (i.e. the old-school username/password box):

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                secured_area:
                    pattern:    ^/
                    anonymous: ~
                    http_basic:
                        realm: "Secured Demo Area"

            access_control:
                - { path: ^/admin, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }

            providers:
                in_memory:
                    memory:
                        users:
                            ryan:  { password: ryanpass, roles: 'ROLE_USER' }
                            admin: { password: kitten, roles: 'ROLE_ADMIN' }

                'Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User' => 'plaintext',
            ),
        ));

.. tip::

    A standard Symfony distribution separates the security configuration
    into a separate file (e.g. ``app/config/security.yml``). If you don't
    have a separate security file, you can put the configuration directly
    into your main config file (e.g. ``app/config/config.yml``).

The end result of this configuration is a fully-functional security system
that looks like the following:

* There are two users in the system (``ryan`` and ``admin``);
* Users authenticate themselves via the basic HTTP authentication prompt;
* Any URL matching ``/admin/*`` is secured, and only the ``admin`` user
  can access it;
* All URLs *not* matching ``/admin/*`` are accessible by all users (and the
  user is never prompted to login).

Let's look briefly at how security works and how each part of the configuration
comes into play.

How Security Works: Authentication and Authorization
----------------------------------------------------

Symfony's security system works by determining who a user is (i.e. authentication)
and then checking to see if that user should have access to a specific resource
or URL.

Firewalls (Authentication)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a user makes a request to a URL that's protected by a firewall, the
security system is activated. The job of the firewall is to determine whether
or not the user needs to be authenticated, and if he does, to send a response
back to the user initiating the authentication process.

A firewall is activated when the URL of an incoming request matches the configured
firewall's regular expression ``pattern`` config value. In this example, the
``pattern`` (``^/``) will match *every* incoming request. The fact that the
firewall is activated does *not* mean, however, that the HTTP authentication
username and password box is displayed for every URL. For example, any user
can access ``/foo`` without being prompted to authenticate.

.. image:: /images/book/security_anonymous_user_access.png
   :align: center

This works first because the firewall allows *anonymous users* via the ``anonymous``
configuration parameter. In other words, the firewall doesn't require the
user to fully authenticate immediately. And because no special ``role`` is
needed to access ``/foo`` (under the ``access_control`` section), the request
can be fulfilled without ever asking the user to authenticate.

If you remove the ``anonymous`` key, the firewall will *always* make a user
fully authenticate immediately.

Access Controls (Authorization)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user requests ``/admin/foo``, however, the process behaves differently.
This is because of the ``access_control`` configuration section that says
that any URL matching the regular expression pattern ``^/admin`` (i.e. ``/admin``
or anything matching ``/admin/*``) requires the ``ROLE_ADMIN`` role. Roles
are the basis for most authorization: a user can access ``/admin/foo`` only
if it has the ``ROLE_ADMIN`` role.

.. image:: /images/book/security_anonymous_user_denied_authorization.png
   :align: center

Like before, when the user originally makes the request, the firewall doesn't
ask for any identification. However, as soon as the access control layer
denies the user access (because the anonymous user doesn't have the ``ROLE_ADMIN``
role), the firewall jumps into action and initiates the authentication process.
The authentication process depends on the authentication mechanism you're
using. For example, if you're using the form login authentication method,
the user will be redirected to the login page. If you're using HTTP authentication,
the user will be sent an HTTP 401 response so that the user sees the username
and password box.

The user now has the opportunity to submit its credentials back to the application.
If the credentials are valid, the original request can be re-tried.

.. image:: /images/book/security_ryan_no_role_admin_access.png
   :align: center

In this example, the user ``ryan`` successfully authenticates with the firewall.
But since ``ryan`` doesn't have the ``ROLE_ADMIN`` role, he's still denied
access to ``/admin/foo``. Ultimately, this means that the user will see some
sort of message indicating that access has been denied.

.. tip::

    When Symfony denies the user access, the user sees an error screen and
    receives a 403 HTTP status code (``Forbidden``). You can customize the
    access denied error screen by following the directions in the
    :ref:`Error Pages<cookbook-error-pages-by-status-code>` cookbook entry
    to customize the 403 error page.

Finally, if the ``admin`` user requests ``/admin/foo``, a similar process
takes place, except now, after being authenticated, the access control layer
will let the request pass through:

.. image:: /images/book/security_admin_role_access.png
   :align: center

The request flow when a user requests a protected resource is straightforward,
but incredibly flexible. As you'll see later, authentication can be handled
in any number of ways, including via a form login, X.509 certificate, or by
authenticating the user via Twitter. Regardless of the authentication method,
the request flow is always the same:

#. A user accesses a protected resource;
#. The application redirects the user to the login form;
#. The user submits its credentials (e.g. username/password);
#. The firewall authenticates the user;
#. The authenticated user re-tries the original request.

.. note::

    The *exact* process actually depends a little bit on which authentication
    mechanism you're using. For example, when using form login, the user
    submits its credentials to one URL that processes the form (e.g. ``/login_check``)
    and then is redirected back to the originally requested URL (e.g. ``/admin/foo``).
    But with HTTP authentication, the user submits its credentials directly
    to the original URL (e.g. ``/admin/foo``) and then the page is returned
    to the user in that same request (i.e. no redirect).

    These types of idiosyncrasies shouldn't cause you any problems, but they're
    good to keep in mind.

.. tip::

    You'll also learn later how *anything* can be secured in Symfony2, including
    specific controllers, objects, or even PHP methods.

.. _book-security-form-login:

Using a Traditional Login Form
------------------------------

.. tip::

    In this section, you'll learn how to create a basic login form that continues
    to use the hard-coded users that are defined in the ``security.yml`` file.

    To load users from the database, please read :doc:`/cookbook/security/entity_provider`.
    By reading that article and this section, you can create a full login form
    system that loads users from the database.

So far, you've seen how to blanket your application beneath a firewall and
then protect access to certain areas with roles. By using HTTP Authentication,
you can effortlessly tap into the native username/password box offered by
all browsers. However, Symfony supports many authentication mechanisms out
of the box. For details on all of them, see the
:doc:`Security Configuration Reference</reference/configuration/security>`.

In this section, you'll enhance this process by allowing the user to authenticate
via a traditional HTML login form.

First, enable form login under your firewall:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                secured_area:
                    pattern:    ^/
                    anonymous: ~
                    form_login:
                        login_path:  /login
                        check_path:  /login_check

    .. code-block:: xml

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <!-- app/config/security.xml -->

            <config>
                <firewall name="secured_area" pattern="^/">
                    <anonymous />
                    <form-login login_path="/login" check_path="/login_check" />
                </firewall>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'firewalls' => array(
                'secured_area' => array(
                    'pattern' => '^/',
                    'anonymous' => array(),
                    'form_login' => array(
                        'login_path' => '/login',
                        'check_path' => '/login_check',
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ));

.. tip::

    If you don't need to customize your ``login_path`` or ``check_path``
    values (the values used here are the default values), you can shorten
    your configuration:

    .. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: yaml

            form_login: ~

        .. code-block:: xml

            <form-login />

        .. code-block:: php

            'form_login' => array(),

Now, when the security system initiates the authentication process, it will
redirect the user to the login form (``/login`` by default). Implementing
this login form visually is your job. First, create two routes: one that
will display the login form (i.e. ``/login``) and one that will handle the
login form submission (i.e. ``/login_check``):

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/routing.yml
        login:
            pattern:   /login
            defaults:  { _controller: AcmeSecurityBundle:Security:login }
        login_check:
            pattern:   /login_check

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/routing.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

        <routes xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/routing"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/routing http://symfony.com/schema/routing/routing-1.0.xsd">

            <route id="login" pattern="/login">
                <default key="_controller">AcmeSecurityBundle:Security:login</default>
            </route>
            <route id="login_check" pattern="/login_check" />

        </routes>

    ..  code-block:: php

        // app/config/routing.php
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection;
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\Route;

        $collection = new RouteCollection();
        $collection->add('login', new Route('/login', array(
            '_controller' => 'AcmeDemoBundle:Security:login',
        )));
        $collection->add('login_check', new Route('/login_check', array()));

        return $collection;

.. note::

    You will *not* need to implement a controller for the ``/login_check``
    URL as the firewall will automatically catch and process any form submitted
    to this URL.

.. versionadded:: 2.1
    As of Symfony 2.1, you *must* have routes configured for your ``login_path``
    (e.g. ``/login``), ``check_path`` (e.g. ``/login_check``) and ``logout``
    (e.g. ``/logout`` - see `Logging Out`_) URLs.

Notice that the name of the ``login`` route isn't important. What's important
is that the URL of the route (``/login``) matches the ``login_path`` config
value, as that's where the security system will redirect users that need
to login.

Next, create the controller that will display the login form:

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Acme/SecurityBundle/Controller/SecurityController.php;
    namespace Acme\SecurityBundle\Controller;

    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\SecurityContext;

    class SecurityController extends Controller
    {
        public function loginAction()
        {
            $request = $this->getRequest();
            $session = $request->getSession();

            // get the login error if there is one
            if ($request->attributes->has(SecurityContext::AUTHENTICATION_ERROR)) {
                $error = $request->attributes->get(SecurityContext::AUTHENTICATION_ERROR);
            } else {
                $error = $session->get(SecurityContext::AUTHENTICATION_ERROR);
                $session->remove(SecurityContext::AUTHENTICATION_ERROR);
            }

            return $this->render('AcmeSecurityBundle:Security:login.html.twig', array(
                // last username entered by the user
                'last_username' => $session->get(SecurityContext::LAST_USERNAME),
                'error'         => $error,
            ));
        }
    }

Don't let this controller confuse you. As you'll see in a moment, when the
user submits the form, the security system automatically handles the form
submission for you. If the user had submitted an invalid username or password,
this controller reads the form submission error from the security system so
that it can be displayed back to the user.

In other words, your job is to display the login form and any login errors
that may have occurred, but the security system itself takes care of checking
the submitted username and password and authenticating the user.

Finally, create the corresponding template:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {# src/Acme/SecurityBundle/Resources/views/Security/login.html.twig #}
        {% if error %}
            <div>{{ error.message }}</div>
        {% endif %}

        <form action="{{ path('login_check') }}" method="post">
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="_username" value="{{ last_username }}" />

            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="_password" />

            {#
                If you want to control the URL the user is redirected to on success (more details below)
                <input type="hidden" name="_target_path" value="/account" />
            #}

            <button type="submit">login</button>
        </form>

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php // src/Acme/SecurityBundle/Resources/views/Security/login.html.php ?>
        <?php if ($error): ?>
            <div><?php echo $error->getMessage() ?></div>
        <?php endif; ?>

        <form action="<?php echo $view['router']->generate('login_check') ?>" method="post">
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="_username" value="<?php echo $last_username ?>" />

            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="_password" />

            <!--
                If you want to control the URL the user is redirected to on success (more details below)
                <input type="hidden" name="_target_path" value="/account" />
            -->

            <button type="submit">login</button>
        </form>

.. tip::

    The ``error`` variable passed into the template is an instance of
    :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\AuthenticationException`.
    It may contain more information - or even sensitive information - about
    the authentication failure, so use it wisely!

The form has very few requirements. First, by submitting the form to ``/login_check``
(via the ``login_check`` route), the security system will intercept the form
submission and process the form for you automatically. Second, the security
system expects the submitted fields to be called ``_username`` and ``_password``
(these field names can be :ref:`configured<reference-security-firewall-form-login>`).

And that's it! When you submit the form, the security system will automatically
check the user's credentials and either authenticate the user or send the
user back to the login form where the error can be displayed.

Let's review the whole process:

#. The user tries to access a resource that is protected;
#. The firewall initiates the authentication process by redirecting the
   user to the login form (``/login``);
#. The ``/login`` page renders login form via the route and controller created
   in this example;
#. The user submits the login form to ``/login_check``;
#. The security system intercepts the request, checks the user's submitted
   credentials, authenticates the user if they are correct, and sends the
   user back to the login form if they are not.

By default, if the submitted credentials are correct, the user will be redirected
to the original page that was requested (e.g. ``/admin/foo``). If the user
originally went straight to the login page, he'll be redirected to the homepage.
This can be highly customized, allowing you to, for example, redirect the
user to a specific URL.

For more details on this and how to customize the form login process in general,
see :doc:`/cookbook/security/form_login`.

.. _book-security-common-pitfalls:

.. sidebar:: Avoid Common Pitfalls

    When setting up your login form, watch out for a few common pitfalls.

    **1. Create the correct routes**

    First, be sure that you've defined the ``/login`` and ``/login_check``
    routes correctly and that they correspond to the ``login_path`` and
    ``check_path`` config values. A misconfiguration here can mean that you're
    redirected to a 404 page instead of the login page, or that submitting
    the login form does nothing (you just see the login form over and over
    again).

    **2. Be sure the login page isn't secure**

    Also, be sure that the login page does *not* require any roles to be
    viewed. For example, the following configuration - which requires the
    ``ROLE_ADMIN`` role for all URLs (including the ``/login`` URL), will
    cause a redirect loop:

    .. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: yaml

            access_control:
                - { path: ^/, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }

        .. code-block:: xml

            <access-control>
                <rule path="^/" role="ROLE_ADMIN" />
            </access-control>

        .. code-block:: php

            'access_control' => array(
                array('path' => '^/', 'role' => 'ROLE_ADMIN'),
            ),

    Removing the access control on the ``/login`` URL fixes the problem:

    .. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: yaml

            access_control:
                - { path: ^/login, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
                - { path: ^/, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }

        .. code-block:: xml

            <access-control>
                <rule path="^/login" role="IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY" />
                <rule path="^/" role="ROLE_ADMIN" />
            </access-control>

        .. code-block:: php

            'access_control' => array(
                array('path' => '^/login', 'role' => 'IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'),
                array('path' => '^/', 'role' => 'ROLE_ADMIN'),
            ),

    Also, if your firewall does *not* allow for anonymous users, you'll need
    to create a special firewall that allows anonymous users for the login
    page:

    .. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: yaml

            firewalls:
                login_firewall:
                    pattern:    ^/login$
                    anonymous:  ~
                secured_area:
                    pattern:    ^/
                    form_login: ~

        .. code-block:: xml

            <firewall name="login_firewall" pattern="^/login$">
                <anonymous />
            </firewall>
            <firewall name="secured_area" pattern="^/">
                <form_login />
            </firewall>

        .. code-block:: php

            'firewalls' => array(
                'login_firewall' => array(
                    'pattern' => '^/login$',
                    'anonymous' => array(),
                ),
                'secured_area' => array(
                    'pattern' => '^/',
                    'form_login' => array(),
                ),
            ),

    **3. Be sure ``/login_check`` is behind a firewall**

    Next, make sure that your ``check_path`` URL (e.g. ``/login_check``)
    is behind the firewall you're using for your form login (in this example,
    the single firewall matches *all* URLs, including ``/login_check``). If
    ``/login_check`` doesn't match any firewall, you'll receive a ``Unable
    to find the controller for path "/login_check"`` exception.

    **4. Multiple firewalls don't share security context**

    If you're using multiple firewalls and you authenticate against one firewall,
    you will *not* be authenticated against any other firewalls automatically.
    Different firewalls are like different security systems. That's why,
    for most applications, having one main firewall is enough.

Authorization
-------------

The first step in security is always authentication: the process of verifying
who the user is. With Symfony, authentication can be done in any way - via
a form login, basic HTTP Authentication, or even via Facebook.

Once the user has been authenticated, authorization begins. Authorization
provides a standard and powerful way to decide if a user can access any resource
(a URL, a model object, a method call, ...). This works by assigning specific
roles to each user, and then requiring different roles for different resources.

The process of authorization has two different sides:

#. The user has a specific set of roles;
#. A resource requires a specific role in order to be accessed.

In this section, you'll focus on how to secure different resources (e.g. URLs,
method calls, etc) with different roles. Later, you'll learn more about how
roles are created and assigned to users.

Securing Specific URL Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most basic way to secure part of your application is to secure an entire
URL pattern. You've seen this already in the first example of this chapter,
where anything matching the regular expression pattern ``^/admin`` requires
the ``ROLE_ADMIN`` role.

You can define as many URL patterns as you need - each is a regular expression.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            # ...
            access_control:
                - { path: ^/admin/users, roles: ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN }
                - { path: ^/admin, roles: ROLE_ADMIN }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <!-- ... -->
            <rule path="^/admin/users" role="ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN" />
            <rule path="^/admin" role="ROLE_ADMIN" />
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            // ...
            'access_control' => array(
                array('path' => '^/admin/users', 'role' => 'ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN'),
                array('path' => '^/admin', 'role' => 'ROLE_ADMIN'),
            ),
        ));

.. tip::

    Prepending the path with ``^`` ensures that only URLs *beginning* with
    the pattern are matched. For example, a path of simply ``/admin`` (without
    the ``^``) would correctly match ``/admin/foo`` but would also match URLs
    like ``/foo/admin``.

For each incoming request, Symfony2 tries to find a matching access control
rule (the first one wins). If the user isn't authenticated yet, the authentication
process is initiated (i.e. the user is given a chance to login). However,
if the user *is* authenticated but doesn't have the required role, an
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\AccessDeniedException`
exception is thrown, which you can handle and turn into a nice "access denied"
error page for the user. See :doc:`/cookbook/controller/error_pages` for
more information.

Since Symfony uses the first access control rule it matches, a URL like ``/admin/users/new``
will match the first rule and require only the ``ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`` role.
Any URL like ``/admin/blog`` will match the second rule and require ``ROLE_ADMIN``.

.. _book-security-securing-ip:

Securing by IP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain situations may arise when you may need to restrict access to a given
route based on IP. This is particularly relevant in the case of :ref:`Edge Side Includes<edge-side-includes>`
(ESI), for example, which utilize a route named "_internal". When
ESI is used, the _internal route is required by the gateway cache to enable
different caching options for subsections within a given page. This route
comes with the ^/_internal prefix by default in the standard edition (assuming
you've uncommented those lines from the routing file).

Here is an example of how you might secure this route from outside access:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            # ...
            access_control:
                - { path: ^/_internal, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY, ip: 127.0.0.1 }

    .. code-block:: xml

            <access-control>
                <rule path="^/_internal" role="IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY" ip="127.0.0.1" />
            </access-control>

    .. code-block:: php

            'access_control' => array(
                array('path' => '^/_internal', 'role' => 'IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY', 'ip' => '127.0.0.1'),
            ),

.. _book-security-securing-channel:

Securing by Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Much like securing based on IP, requiring the use of SSL is as simple as
adding a new access_control entry:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            # ...
            access_control:
                - { path: ^/cart/checkout, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY, requires_channel: https }

    .. code-block:: xml

            <access-control>
                <rule path="^/cart/checkout" role="IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY" requires_channel="https" />
            </access-control>

    .. code-block:: php

            'access_control' => array(
                array('path' => '^/cart/checkout', 'role' => 'IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY', 'requires_channel' => 'https'),
            ),

.. _book-security-securing-controller:

Securing a Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Protecting your application based on URL patterns is easy, but may not be
fine-grained enough in certain cases. When necessary, you can easily force
authorization from inside a controller:

.. code-block:: php

    // ...
    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AccessDeniedException;

    public function helloAction($name)
    {
        if (false === $this->get('security.context')->isGranted('ROLE_ADMIN')) {
            throw new AccessDeniedException();
        }

        // ...
    }

.. _book-security-securing-controller-annotations:

You can also choose to install and use the optional ``JMSSecurityExtraBundle``,
which can secure your controller using annotations:

.. code-block:: php

    // ...
    use JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\Annotation\Secure;

    /**
     * @Secure(roles="ROLE_ADMIN")
     */
    public function helloAction($name)
    {
        // ...
    }

For more information, see the `JMSSecurityExtraBundle`_ documentation. If you're
using Symfony's Standard Distribution, this bundle is available by default.
If not, you can easily download and install it.

Securing other Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In fact, anything in Symfony can be protected using a strategy similar to
the one seen in the previous section. For example, suppose you have a service
(i.e. a PHP class) whose job is to send emails from one user to another.
You can restrict use of this class - no matter where it's being used from -
to users that have a specific role.

For more information on how you can use the security component to secure
different services and methods in your application, see :doc:`/cookbook/security/securing_services`.

Access Control Lists (ACLs): Securing Individual Database Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine you are designing a blog system where your users can comment on your
posts. Now, you want a user to be able to edit his own comments, but not
those of other users. Also, as the admin user, you yourself want to be able
to edit *all* comments.

The security component comes with an optional access control list (ACL) system
that you can use when you need to control access to individual instances
of an object in your system. *Without* ACL, you can secure your system so that
only certain users can edit blog comments in general. But *with* ACL, you
can restrict or allow access on a comment-by-comment basis.

For more information, see the cookbook article: :doc:`/cookbook/security/acl`.

Users
-----

In the previous sections, you learned how you can protect different resources
by requiring a set of *roles* for a resource. In this section we'll explore
the other side of authorization: users.

Where do Users come from? (*User Providers*)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During authentication, the user submits a set of credentials (usually a username
and password). The job of the authentication system is to match those credentials
against some pool of users. So where does this list of users come from?

In Symfony2, users can come from anywhere - a configuration file, a database
table, a web service, or anything else you can dream up. Anything that provides
one or more users to the authentication system is known as a "user provider".
Symfony2 comes standard with the two most common user providers: one that
loads users from a configuration file and one that loads users from a database
table.

Specifying Users in a Configuration File
........................................

The easiest way to specify your users is directly in a configuration file.
In fact, you've seen this already in the example in this chapter.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            # ...
            providers:
                default_provider:
                    memory:
                        users:
                            ryan:  { password: ryanpass, roles: 'ROLE_USER' }
                            admin: { password: kitten, roles: 'ROLE_ADMIN' }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <!-- ... -->
            <provider name="default_provider">
                <memory>
                    <user name="ryan" password="ryanpass" roles="ROLE_USER" />
                    <user name="admin" password="kitten" roles="ROLE_ADMIN" />
                </memory>
            </provider>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            // ...
            'providers' => array(
                'default_provider' => array(
                    'memory' => array(
                        'users' => array(
                            'ryan' => array('password' => 'ryanpass', 'roles' => 'ROLE_USER'),
                            'admin' => array('password' => 'kitten', 'roles' => 'ROLE_ADMIN'),
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ));

This user provider is called the "in-memory" user provider, since the users
aren't stored anywhere in a database. The actual user object is provided
by Symfony (:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\User\\User`).

.. tip::
    Any user provider can load users directly from configuration by specifying
    the ``users`` configuration parameter and listing the users beneath it.

.. caution::

    If your username is completely numeric (e.g. ``77``) or contains a dash
    (e.g. ``user-name``), you should use that alternative syntax when specifying
    users in YAML:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        users:
            - { name: 77, password: pass, roles: 'ROLE_USER' }
            - { name: user-name, password: pass, roles: 'ROLE_USER' }

For smaller sites, this method is quick and easy to setup. For more complex
systems, you'll want to load your users from the database.

.. _book-security-user-entity:

Loading Users from the Database
...............................

If you'd like to load your users via the Doctrine ORM, you can easily do
this by creating a ``User`` class and configuring the ``entity`` provider.

.. tip:

    A high-quality open source bundle is available that allows your users
    to be stored via the Doctrine ORM or ODM. Read more about the `FOSUserBundle`_
    on GitHub.

With this approach, you'll first create your own ``User`` class, which will
be stored in the database.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Acme/UserBundle/Entity/User.php
    namespace Acme\UserBundle\Entity;

    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface;
    use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity
     */
    class User implements UserInterface
    {
        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=255)
         */
        protected $username;

        // ...
    }

As far as the security system is concerned, the only requirement for your
custom user class is that it implements the :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\User\\UserInterface`
interface. This means that your concept of a "user" can be anything, as long
as it implements this interface.

.. versionadded:: 2.1
    In Symfony 2.1, the ``equals`` method was removed from ``UserInterface``.
    If you need to override the default implementation of comparison logic,
    implement the new :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\User\\EquatableInterface`
    interface.

.. note::

    The user object will be serialized and saved in the session during requests,
    therefore it is recommended that you `implement the \Serializable interface`_
    in your user object. This is especially important if your ``User`` class
    has a parent class with private properties.

Next, configure an ``entity`` user provider, and point it to your ``User``
class:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            providers:
                main:
                    entity: { class: Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User, property: username }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <provider name="main">
                <entity class="Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User" property="username" />
            </provider>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'providers' => array(
                'main' => array(
                    'entity' => array('class' => 'Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User', 'property' => 'username'),
                ),
            ),
        ));

With the introduction of this new provider, the authentication system will
attempt to load a ``User`` object from the database by using the ``username``
field of that class.

.. note::
    This example is just meant to show you the basic idea behind the ``entity``
    provider. For a full working example, see :doc:`/cookbook/security/entity_provider`.

For more information on creating your own custom provider (e.g. if you needed
to load users via a web service), see :doc:`/cookbook/security/custom_provider`.

.. _book-security-encoding-user-password:

Encoding the User's Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far, for simplicity, all the examples have stored the users' passwords
in plain text (whether those users are stored in a configuration file or in
a database somewhere). Of course, in a real application, you'll want to encode
your users' passwords for security reasons. This is easily accomplished by
mapping your User class to one of several built-in "encoders". For example,
to store your users in memory, but obscure their passwords via ``sha1``,
do the following:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            # ...
            providers:
                in_memory:
                    memory:
                        users:
                            ryan:  { password: bb87a29949f3a1ee0559f8a57357487151281386, roles: 'ROLE_USER' }
                            admin: { password: 74913f5cd5f61ec0bcfdb775414c2fb3d161b620, roles: 'ROLE_ADMIN' }

            encoders:
                Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User:
                    algorithm:   sha1
                    iterations: 1
                    encode_as_base64: false

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <!-- ... -->
            <provider name="in_memory">
                <memory>
                    <user name="ryan" password="bb87a29949f3a1ee0559f8a57357487151281386" roles="ROLE_USER" />
                    <user name="admin" password="74913f5cd5f61ec0bcfdb775414c2fb3d161b620" roles="ROLE_ADMIN" />
                </memory>
            </provider>

            <encoder class="Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User" algorithm="sha1" iterations="1" encode_as_base64="false" />
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            // ...
            'providers' => array(
                'in_memory' => array(
                    'memory' => array(
                        'users' => array(
                            'ryan' => array('password' => 'bb87a29949f3a1ee0559f8a57357487151281386', 'roles' => 'ROLE_USER'),
                            'admin' => array('password' => '74913f5cd5f61ec0bcfdb775414c2fb3d161b620', 'roles' => 'ROLE_ADMIN'),
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
            ),
            'encoders' => array(
                'Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\User' => array(
                    'algorithm'         => 'sha1',
                    'iterations'        => 1,
                    'encode_as_base64'  => false,
                ),
            ),
        ));

By setting the ``iterations`` to ``1`` and the ``encode_as_base64`` to false,
the password is simply run through the ``sha1`` algorithm one time and without
any extra encoding. You can now calculate the hashed password either programmatically
(e.g. ``hash('sha1', 'ryanpass')``) or via some online tool like `functions-online.com`_

If you're creating your users dynamically (and storing them in a database),
you can use even tougher hashing algorithms and then rely on an actual password
encoder object to help you encode passwords. For example, suppose your User
object is ``Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User`` (like in the above example). First,
configure the encoder for that user:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            # ...

            encoders:
                Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User: sha512

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <!-- ... -->

            <encoder class="Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User" algorithm="sha512" />
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            // ...

            'encoders' => array(
                'Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User' => 'sha512',
            ),
        ));

In this case, you're using the stronger ``sha512`` algorithm. Also, since
you've simply specified the algorithm (``sha512``) as a string, the system
will default to hashing your password 5000 times in a row and then encoding
it as base64. In other words, the password has been greatly obfuscated so
that the hashed password can't be decoded (i.e. you can't determine the password
from the hashed password).

If you have some sort of registration form for users, you'll need to be able
to determine the hashed password so that you can set it on your user. No
matter what algorithm you configure for your user object, the hashed password
can always be determined in the following way from a controller:

.. code-block:: php

    $factory = $this->get('security.encoder_factory');
    $user = new Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User();

    $encoder = $factory->getEncoder($user);
    $password = $encoder->encodePassword('ryanpass', $user->getSalt());
    $user->setPassword($password);

Retrieving the User Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After authentication, the ``User`` object of the current user can be accessed
via the ``security.context`` service. From inside a controller, this will
look like:

.. code-block:: php

    public function indexAction()
    {
        $user = $this->get('security.context')->getToken()->getUser();
    }

In a controller this can be shortcut to:

.. code-block:: php

    public function indexAction()
    {
        $user = $this->getUser();
    }


.. note::

    Anonymous users are technically authenticated, meaning that the ``isAuthenticated()``
    method of an anonymous user object will return true. To check if your
    user is actually authenticated, check for the ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY``
    role.
    
In a Twig Template this object can be accessed via the ``app.user`` key,
which calls the :method:`GlobalVariables::getUser()<Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Templating\\GlobalVariables::getUser>`
method:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        <p>Username: {{ app.user.username }}</p>


Using Multiple User Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each authentication mechanism (e.g. HTTP Authentication, form login, etc)
uses exactly one user provider, and will use the first declared user provider
by default. But what if you want to specify a few users via configuration
and the rest of your users in the database? This is possible by creating
a new provider that chains the two together:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            providers:
                chain_provider:
                    chain:
                        providers: [in_memory, user_db]
                in_memory:
                    users:
                        foo: { password: test }
                user_db:
                    entity: { class: Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User, property: username }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <provider name="chain_provider">
                <chain>
                    <provider>in_memory</provider>
                    <provider>user_db</provider>
                </chain>
            </provider>
            <provider name="in_memory">
                <user name="foo" password="test" />
            </provider>
            <provider name="user_db">
                <entity class="Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User" property="username" />
            </provider>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'providers' => array(
                'chain_provider' => array(
                    'chain' => array(
                        'providers' => array('in_memory', 'user_db'),
                    ),
                ),
                'in_memory' => array(
                    'users' => array(
                        'foo' => array('password' => 'test'),
                    ),
                ),
                'user_db' => array(
                    'entity' => array('class' => 'Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User', 'property' => 'username'),
                ),
            ),
        ));

Now, all authentication mechanisms will use the ``chain_provider``, since
it's the first specified. The ``chain_provider`` will, in turn, try to load
the user from both the ``in_memory`` and ``user_db`` providers.

.. tip::

    If you have no reasons to separate your ``in_memory`` users from your
    ``user_db`` users, you can accomplish this even more easily by combining
    the two sources into a single provider:

    .. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: yaml

            # app/config/security.yml
            security:
                providers:
                    main_provider:
                        memory:
                            users:
                                foo: { password: test }
                        entity:
                            class: Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User,
                            property: username

        .. code-block:: xml

            <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
            <config>
                <provider name=="main_provider">
                    <memory>
                        <user name="foo" password="test" />
                    </memory>
                    <entity class="Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User" property="username" />
                </provider>
            </config>

        .. code-block:: php

            // app/config/security.php
            $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
                'providers' => array(
                    'main_provider' => array(
                        'memory' => array(
                            'users' => array(
                                'foo' => array('password' => 'test'),
                            ),
                        ),
                        'entity' => array('class' => 'Acme\UserBundle\Entity\User', 'property' => 'username'),
                    ),
                ),
            ));

You can also configure the firewall or individual authentication mechanisms
to use a specific provider. Again, unless a provider is specified explicitly,
the first provider is always used:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                secured_area:
                    # ...
                    provider: user_db
                    http_basic:
                        realm: "Secured Demo Area"
                        provider: in_memory
                    form_login: ~

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <firewall name="secured_area" pattern="^/" provider="user_db">
                <!-- ... -->
                <http-basic realm="Secured Demo Area" provider="in_memory" />
                <form-login />
            </firewall>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'firewalls' => array(
                'secured_area' => array(
                    // ...
                    'provider' => 'user_db',
                    'http_basic' => array(
                        // ...
                        'provider' => 'in_memory',
                    ),
                    'form_login' => array(),
                ),
            ),
        ));

In this example, if a user tries to login via HTTP authentication, the authentication
system will use the ``in_memory`` user provider. But if the user tries to
login via the form login, the ``user_db`` provider will be used (since it's
the default for the firewall as a whole).

For more information about user provider and firewall configuration, see
the :doc:`/reference/configuration/security`.

Roles
-----

The idea of a "role" is key to the authorization process. Each user is assigned
a set of roles and then each resource requires one or more roles. If the user
has the required roles, access is granted. Otherwise access is denied.

Roles are pretty simple, and are basically strings that you can invent and
use as needed (though roles are objects internally). For example, if you
need to start limiting access to the blog admin section of your website,
you could protect that section using a ``ROLE_BLOG_ADMIN`` role. This role
doesn't need to be defined anywhere - you can just start using it.

.. note::

    All roles **must** begin with the ``ROLE_`` prefix to be managed by
    Symfony2. If you define your own roles with a dedicated ``Role`` class
    (more advanced), don't use the ``ROLE_`` prefix.

Hierarchical Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of associating many roles to users, you can define role inheritance
rules by creating a role hierarchy:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            role_hierarchy:
                ROLE_ADMIN:       ROLE_USER
                ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: [ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH]

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <role id="ROLE_ADMIN">ROLE_USER</role>
            <role id="ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN">ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH</role>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'role_hierarchy' => array(
                'ROLE_ADMIN'       => 'ROLE_USER',
                'ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN' => array('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH'),
            ),
        ));

In the above configuration, users with ``ROLE_ADMIN`` role will also have the
``ROLE_USER`` role. The ``ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`` role has ``ROLE_ADMIN``, ``ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH``
and ``ROLE_USER`` (inherited from ``ROLE_ADMIN``).

Logging Out
-----------

Usually, you'll also want your users to be able to log out. Fortunately,
the firewall can handle this automatically for you when you activate the
``logout`` config parameter:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                secured_area:
                    # ...
                    logout:
                        path:   /logout
                        target: /
            # ...

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <firewall name="secured_area" pattern="^/">
                <!-- ... -->
                <logout path="/logout" target="/" />
            </firewall>
            <!-- ... -->
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'firewalls' => array(
                'secured_area' => array(
                    // ...
                    'logout' => array('path' => 'logout', 'target' => '/'),
                ),
            ),
            // ...
        ));

Once this is configured under your firewall, sending a user to ``/logout``
(or whatever you configure the ``path`` to be), will un-authenticate the
current user. The user will then be sent to the homepage (the value defined
by the ``target`` parameter). Both the ``path`` and ``target`` config parameters
default to what's specified here. In other words, unless you need to customize
them, you can omit them entirely and shorten your configuration:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        logout: ~

    .. code-block:: xml

        <logout />

    .. code-block:: php

        'logout' => array(),

Note that you will *not* need to implement a controller for the ``/logout``
URL as the firewall takes care of everything. You *do*, however, need to create
a route so that you can use it to generate the URL:

.. warning::

    As of Symfony 2.1, you *must* have a route that corresponds to your logout
    path. Without this route, logging out will not work.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/routing.yml
        logout:
            pattern:   /logout

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/routing.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

        <routes xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/routing"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/routing http://symfony.com/schema/routing/routing-1.0.xsd">

            <route id="logout" pattern="/logout" />

        </routes>

    ..  code-block:: php

        // app/config/routing.php
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollection;
        use Symfony\Component\Routing\Route;

        $collection = new RouteCollection();
        $collection->add('logout', new Route('/logout', array()));

        return $collection;

Once the user has been logged out, he will be redirected to whatever path
is defined by the ``target`` parameter above (e.g. the ``homepage``). For
more information on configuring the logout, see the
:doc:`Security Configuration Reference</reference/configuration/security>`.

Access Control in Templates
---------------------------

If you want to check if the current user has a role inside a template, use
the built-in helper function:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% if is_granted('ROLE_ADMIN') %}
            <a href="...">Delete</a>
        {% endif %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php if ($view['security']->isGranted('ROLE_ADMIN')): ?>
            <a href="...">Delete</a>
        <?php endif; ?>

.. note::

    If you use this function and are *not* at a URL where there is a firewall
    active, an exception will be thrown. Again, it's almost always a good
    idea to have a main firewall that covers all URLs (as has been shown
    in this chapter).

Access Control in Controllers
-----------------------------

If you want to check if the current user has a role in your controller, use
the ``isGranted`` method of the security context:

.. code-block:: php

    public function indexAction()
    {
        // show different content to admin users
        if ($this->get('security.context')->isGranted('ROLE_ADMIN')) {
            // Load admin content here
        }
        // load other regular content here
    }

.. note::

    A firewall must be active or an exception will be thrown when the ``isGranted``
    method is called. See the note above about templates for more details.

Impersonating a User
--------------------

Sometimes, it's useful to be able to switch from one user to another without
having to logout and login again (for instance when you are debugging or trying
to understand a bug a user sees that you can't reproduce). This can be easily
done by activating the ``switch_user`` firewall listener:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                main:
                    # ...
                    switch_user: true

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <firewall>
                <!-- ... -->
                <switch-user />
            </firewall>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'firewalls' => array(
                'main'=> array(
                    // ...
                    'switch_user' => true
                ),
            ),
        ));

To switch to another user, just add a query string with the ``_switch_user``
parameter and the username as the value to the current URL:

    http://example.com/somewhere?_switch_user=thomas

To switch back to the original user, use the special ``_exit`` username:

    http://example.com/somewhere?_switch_user=_exit

Of course, this feature needs to be made available to a small group of users.
By default, access is restricted to users having the ``ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH``
role. The name of this role can be modified via the ``role`` setting. For
extra security, you can also change the query parameter name via the ``parameter``
setting:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                main:
                    // ...
                    switch_user: { role: ROLE_ADMIN, parameter: _want_to_be_this_user }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <firewall>
                <!-- ... -->
                <switch-user role="ROLE_ADMIN" parameter="_want_to_be_this_user" />
            </firewall>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'firewalls' => array(
                'main'=> array(
                    // ...
                    'switch_user' => array('role' => 'ROLE_ADMIN', 'parameter' => '_want_to_be_this_user'),
                ),
            ),
        ));

Stateless Authentication
------------------------

By default, Symfony2 relies on a cookie (the Session) to persist the security
context of the user. But if you use certificates or HTTP authentication for
instance, persistence is not needed as credentials are available for each
request. In that case, and if you don't need to store anything else between
requests, you can activate the stateless authentication (which means that no
cookie will be ever created by Symfony2):

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                main:
                    http_basic: ~
                    stateless:  true

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <firewall stateless="true">
                <http-basic />
            </firewall>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'firewalls' => array(
                'main' => array('http_basic' => array(), 'stateless' => true),
            ),
        ));

.. note::

    If you use a form login, Symfony2 will create a cookie even if you set
    ``stateless`` to ``true``.

Final Words
-----------

Security can be a deep and complex issue to solve correctly in your application.
Fortunately, Symfony's security component follows a well-proven security
model based around *authentication* and *authorization*. Authentication,
which always happens first, is handled by a firewall whose job is to determine
the identity of the user through several different methods (e.g. HTTP authentication,
login form, etc). In the cookbook, you'll find examples of other methods
for handling authentication, including how to implement a "remember me" cookie
functionality.

Once a user is authenticated, the authorization layer can determine whether
or not the user should have access to a specific resource. Most commonly,
*roles* are applied to URLs, classes or methods and if the current user
doesn't have that role, access is denied. The authorization layer, however,
is much deeper, and follows a system of "voting" so that multiple parties
can determine if the current user should have access to a given resource.
Find out more about this and other topics in the cookbook.
