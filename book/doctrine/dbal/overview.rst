DBAL
====

The `Doctrine`_ Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL) is an abstraction layer that
sits on top of `PDO`_ and offers an intuitive and flexible API for
communicating with the most popular relational databases that exist today!

.. tip::

    You can read more about the Doctrine DBAL on the official `documentation`_
    website.

To get started you just need to enable and configure the DBAL:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml

    doctrine:
        dbal:
            connections:
                default:
                    driver:   pdo_mysql
                    dbname:   Symfony2
                    user:     root
                    password: null

You can then access the Doctrine DBAL connection by accessing the
``database_connection`` service:

.. code-block:: php

    class UserController extends Controller
    {
        public function indexAction()
        {
            $conn = $this->get('database_connection');

            $users = $conn->fetchAll('SELECT * FROM users');
        }
    }
