Side question: Is there specific maximum/ideal pixel-size for profiler icons? The largest ones seem to be around 42x30.

Is there more than needs to happen to this for it to be ready for 2.6?

For the SVG-icon issue, I'd like to do that as as a separate pull-request against the 2.7 branch.

@WouterJ , @Stof : Is this OK for 2.6? I can make a separate PR against 2.7 using SVG icons.

Is there anything I can do to help move this forward?
