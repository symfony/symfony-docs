The content of the ``caution`` directive needs to be indented by four spaces.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, my bad. Just fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-10-20T21:17:36Z

That's also true for the other two ``caution`` directives. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2014-10-21T06:41:18Z

Args. Fixed.

I've give this the "on hold" label and a `[WCM]` prefix since it's waiting on the referenced code PR. If I'm mis-reading something, let me know - I rarely find things mis-labeled, so it's making me second-guess myself :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2014-10-29T16:58:38Z

All right. It's just prepared for the mentioned PR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2014-11-02T12:37:01Z

btw, this needs a rebase

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2014-11-02T19:43:06Z

Reference added and rebased.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2014-11-04T06:57:06Z

Fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2014-11-06T12:54:33Z

Even though I have fixed it the build still fails.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-11-06T13:28:29Z

I don't understand why this is failing. The error message doesn't match the actual code. I also ran your pull request locally and it built successfully. If nobody else knows the source of the build failure, I think this can be merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2014-11-06T18:54:36Z

I restarted travis and now the build passes :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@WouterJ That's funny because I also tried that yesterday without any effect. :D Thank you!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2014-11-06T21:30:17Z

Thanks! However I guess it is still on hold as the corresponding PR is not yet merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-11-06T21:31:44Z

@peterrehm Uh, thanks for pointing this out.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2015-06-18T12:43:37Z

The PR is now merged. @peterrehm can you please rebase this PR once again?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2015-06-19T01:05:32Z

@WouterJ Has just been updated. I assume this applies now to 2.8.
