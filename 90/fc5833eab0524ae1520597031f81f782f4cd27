@OskarStark can you please help DOCtor-RST? I think there is an issue with https://github.com/OskarStark/doctor-rst/blob/e4b46021e110dc5aed0ee62d6513a61ab9ebf64f/src/Rule/PhpPrefixBeforeBinConsole.php , it shouldn't report

```

contributing/code/stack_trace.rst âœ˜
  161: Please add "php" prefix before "bin/console"
   ->  Symfony\Component\Console\Application->run() at /home/greg/dev/sf-demo/bin/console:42
```
