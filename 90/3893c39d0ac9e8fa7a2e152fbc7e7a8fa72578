Thomas, thanks again for this proposal, but to be honest, this does not differ much from the original sentences. Yes, it looks a bit different, but how it is displayed is opinionated in my eyes. Other than that, it would be more helpful to close issues we have and open PRs for undocumented features üôè

That does not mean your contributions are not welcome, but they take time for you and us, and does not add much value to the overall docs.

I am against merging this PR, but lets see, what the others think.

Thank you for your understanding
