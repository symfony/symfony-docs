Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 5.4, 6.4, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2.

Cheers!

Okay, so I changed the base to 6.4 as 6.3 is no longer maintained.

> I'm not sure how to distribute this PR to all other branches - should I create separate PRs for each?

There's no need for more than one PR. We always merge lower branches up into all maintained branches so that each change will eventually land in all still maintained doc versions.
