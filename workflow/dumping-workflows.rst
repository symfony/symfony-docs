How to Dump Workflows
=====================

To help you debug your workflows, you can dump a representation of your workflow with
the use of a ``DumperInterface``. Use the ``GraphvizDumper`` to create a
PNG image of the workflow defined above::

    // dump-graph.php
    $dumper = new GraphvizDumper();
    echo $dumper->dump($definition);

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php dump-graph.php | dot -Tpng -o graph.png

The result will look like this:

.. image:: /_images/components/workflow/blogpost.png

If you have configured your workflow with the Symfony framework, you may dump the dot file
with the ``WorkflowDumpCommand``:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console workflow:dump name | dot -Tpng -o graph.png

.. note::

    The ``dot`` command is part of Graphviz. You can download it and read
    more about it on `Graphviz.org`_.
