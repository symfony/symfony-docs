I think we should add a tip that you need to clear the Opcache when you deploy application (we do something similar in the Composer autoloader section).

Status: Needs work

@javiereguiluz So should we now update here to reflect the deprecations made in symfony/symfony#20777?

@xabbuh to be honest I'd like this to be merged .... because I want to make a lot of changes in it. I'll add the apcu thing to the list of future changes. Thanks!
