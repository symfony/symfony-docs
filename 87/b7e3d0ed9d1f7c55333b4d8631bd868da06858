:+1: it makes sense to remove this article.

I think we can just completely remove this article. When people find the 404 page and start looking, they'll soon find the blog post.

Also, there doesn't seem to be [any backlinks for this article](https://www.google.nl/search?q=link%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fsymfony.com%2Fdoc%2Fcurrent%2Fcontributing%2Fdocumentation%2Ftranslations.html).

I'm fine with that either.

@javiereguiluz @weaverryan What do you think?

In my previous comment I was referring to remove the content but not the article. I'd prefer not to show a 404 error, even if the traffic to this article is marginal.

:+1: for this approach
