I'm divided about this proposal. I like it and I think it's better ... but it would require us to change lots of PHP examples in the entire documentation and this `<?=` is only "always available" since PHP 5.4:

![php_short_tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/16220479/7388523c-378d-11e6-9b41-85e35ec9afa6.png)

However, Symfony 2.7 and 2.8 still require PHP >= 5.3.9, so this would require us to introduce a lot of differences between the doc versions. I don't know if it's worth it.

As the examples you change here are examples of how you might have written code before using Symfony I think we can still stick with the old syntax.

I'm üëç on this PR. I think we should also do it in the rest of the docs:

 * It's a simple search & replace for `<?php echo` to `<?=`, so the amount of required changes is not a blocker
 * PHP 5.4 has reached end of life for [almost a year](http://php.net/supported-versions.php)
 * It makes PHP templates a bit nicer
 * When applying this to the 2.7 branch, we avoid any merge conflicts
