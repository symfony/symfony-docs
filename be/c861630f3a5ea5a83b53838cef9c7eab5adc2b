Sorry I missed this. It makes total sense. When we have duplicated sections like this, we can isolate that section into its own file and use `include::` to include it - see `reference/constraints/Choice.rst` for an option it includes `/reference/constraints/_payload-option.rst.inc` (we always end the included files in .inc so that they are not parsed as standalone files). Could you isolate this section into a .inc file and include from both documents?

Thanks!
