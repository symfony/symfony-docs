The code for this has been merged into `symfony/symfony` `master` https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/31889. It will be released in `symfony` `5.1`. I've updated this merge request accordingly (again). Can someone please review / merge?

@javiereguiluz I've fixed the branch, also noticed the DBAL link was broken (Doctrine dropped the DBAL dir using psr-4) so i've updated it
