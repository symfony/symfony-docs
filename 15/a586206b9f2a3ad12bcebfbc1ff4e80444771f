Hm... About the CI not showing all errors.

It will not show [this error](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/15269/checks#step:11:49) and anything after it. Earlier, it did not show [this error](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/runs/2403843016#step:11:11) and anything after it.

It make sense if there were a special character that was being printed, but I dont see any. But all `::error`Â [commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-error-message) are "reset" after line break. So if one has wrong syntax then it wont effect the next line.

(Btw I [urlencode the line breaks](https://github.com/symfony-docs-tools/code-block-checker/blob/main/src/Command/CheckDocsCommand.php#L181) to have a multi line comment.)
