Hi,
Is it possible to show how to use custom transport factory by loading the dsn from a property of the current user requesting Symfony ?
This should also be very usefull .
Thank you

Hello,

Does a transport gets created in every request? Just wondering because not sure how good would be doing that ðŸ¤”

Could you elaborate on a specific example?

Cheers
