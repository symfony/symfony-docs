I think you mixed some things up, and you meant: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/26555

Travis is failing with this:

```
/home/travis/build/symfony/symfony-docs/reference/constraints/Unique.rst::
WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
```

But the new file is included in:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/11247/files#diff-5c99f0007238ae4a681869aa8713c3fdR40

I'm lost :neutral_face:

I think you need to include it here

https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/master/reference/constraints.rst

Your linked file is just an include but not an include in a toctree

You are right Oskar! Thanks a lot. I've fixed the missing reference.
