Unfortunately for you, the [`register()` method is hardcoded](https://github.com/symfony/dependency-injection/blob/master/ContainerBuilder.php#L682-L685). So it should work the same for you. (in other words, you might do something else wrong).

You can ask for help using one of the [support channels](http://symfony.com/support).
