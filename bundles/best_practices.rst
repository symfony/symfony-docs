Best Practices for Reusable Bundles
===================================

There are two types of bundles:

* Application-specific bundles: only used to build your application;
* Reusable bundles: meant to be shared across many projects.

This article is all about how to structure your **reusable bundles** so that
they're easy to configure and extend. Many of these recommendations do not
apply to application bundles because you'll want to keep those as simple
as possible. For application bundles, just follow the practices shown throughout
the guides.

    The best practices for application-specific bundles are discussed in
    :doc:`/best_practices/introduction`.

Bundle Name
-----------

A bundle is also a PHP namespace. The namespace must follow the `PSR-0`_ or
`PSR-4`_ interoperability standards for PHP namespaces and class names: it starts
with a vendor segment, followed by zero or more category segments, and it ends
with the namespace short name, which must end with a ``Bundle`` suffix.

A namespace becomes a bundle as soon as you add a bundle class to it. The
bundle class name must follow these simple rules:

* Use only alphanumeric characters and underscores;
* Use a CamelCased name;
* Use a descriptive and short name (no more than two words);
* Prefix the name with the concatenation of the vendor (and optionally the
  category namespaces);
* Suffix the name with ``Bundle``.

Here are some valid bundle namespaces and class names:

==========================  ==================
Namespace                   Bundle Class Name
==========================  ==================
``Acme\Bundle\BlogBundle``  ``AcmeBlogBundle``
``Acme\BlogBundle``         ``AcmeBlogBundle``
==========================  ==================

By convention, the ``getName()`` method of the bundle class should return the
class name.

.. note::

    If you share your bundle publicly, you must use the bundle class name as
    the name of the repository (``AcmeBlogBundle`` and not ``BlogBundle``
    for instance).

.. note::

    Symfony core Bundles do not prefix the Bundle class with ``Symfony``
    and always add a ``Bundle`` sub-namespace; for example:
    :class:`Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\FrameworkBundle`.

Each bundle has an alias, which is the lower-cased short version of the bundle
name using underscores (``acme_blog`` for ``AcmeBlogBundle``). This alias
is used to enforce uniqueness within a project and for defining bundle's
configuration options (see below for some usage examples).

Directory Structure
-------------------

The basic directory structure of an AcmeBlogBundle must read as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    <your-bundle>/
    ├─ AcmeBlogBundle.php
    ├─ Controller/
    ├─ README.md
    ├─ LICENSE
    ├─ Resources/
    │   ├─ config/
    │   ├─ doc/
    │   │  └─ index.rst
    │   ├─ translations/
    │   ├─ views/
    │   └─ public/
    └─ Tests/

**The following files are mandatory**, because they ensure a structure convention
that automated tools can rely on:

* ``AcmeBlogBundle.php``: This is the class that transforms a plain directory
  into a Symfony bundle (change this to your bundle's name);
* ``README.md``: This file contains the basic description of the bundle and it
  usually shows some basic examples and links to its full documentation (it
  can use any of the markup formats supported by GitHub, such as ``README.rst``);
* ``LICENSE``: The full contents of the license used by the code. Most third-party
  bundles are published under the MIT license, but you can `choose any license`_;
* ``Resources/doc/index.rst``: The root file for the Bundle documentation.

The depth of sub-directories should be kept to the minimum for most used
classes and files (two levels maximum).

The bundle directory is read-only. If you need to write temporary files, store
them under the ``cache/`` or ``log/`` directory of the host application. Tools
can generate files in the bundle directory structure, but only if the generated
files are going to be part of the repository.

The following classes and files have specific emplacements (some are mandatory
and others are just conventions followed by most developers):

===============================  =============================  ================
Type                             Directory                      Mandatory?
===============================  =============================  ================
Commands                         ``Command/``                   Yes
Controllers                      ``Controller/``                No
Service Container Extensions     ``DependencyInjection/``       Yes
Event Listeners                  ``EventListener/``             No
Model classes [1]                ``Model/``                     No
Configuration                    ``Resources/config/``          No
Web Resources (CSS, JS, images)  ``Resources/public/``          Yes
Translation files                ``Resources/translations/``    Yes
Templates                        ``Resources/views/``           Yes
Unit and Functional Tests        ``Tests/``                     No
===============================  =============================  ================

mapping with a compiler pass.

Classes
-------

The bundle directory structure is used as the namespace hierarchy. For
instance, a ``ContentController`` controller is stored in
``Acme/BlogBundle/Controller/ContentController.php`` and the fully qualified
class name is ``Acme\BlogBundle\Controller\ContentController``.

All classes and files must follow the :doc:`Symfony coding standards </contributing/code/standards>`.

Some classes should be seen as facades and should be as short as possible, like
Commands, Helpers, Listeners and Controllers.

Classes that connect to the event dispatcher should be suffixed with
``Listener``.

Exception classes should be stored in an ``Exception`` sub-namespace.

Vendors
-------

A bundle must not embed third-party PHP libraries. It should rely on the
standard Symfony autoloading instead.

A bundle should not embed third-party libraries written in JavaScript, CSS or
any other language.

Tests
-----

A bundle should come with a test suite written with PHPUnit and stored under
the ``Tests/`` directory. Tests should follow the following principles:

* The test suite must be executable with a simple ``phpunit`` command run from
  a sample application;
* The functional tests should only be used to test the response output and
  some profiling information if you have some;
* The tests should cover at least 95% of the code base.

.. note::

   A test suite must not contain ``AllTests.php`` scripts, but must rely on the
   existence of a ``phpunit.xml.dist`` file.

Documentation
-------------

All classes and functions must come with full PHPDoc.

Extensive documentation should also be provided in the
:doc:`reStructuredText </contributing/documentation/format>` format, under
the ``Resources/doc/`` directory; the ``Resources/doc/index.rst`` file is
the only mandatory file and must be the entry point for the documentation.

Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to ease the installation of third-party bundles, consider using the
following standardized instructions in your ``README.md`` file.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: markdown

        Installation
        ============

        Step 1: Download the Bundle
        ---------------------------

        Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
        following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

        ```console
        $ composer require <package-name>
        ```

        This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
        in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
        of the Composer documentation.

        Step 2: Enable the Bundle
        -------------------------

        Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
        in the `app/AppKernel.php` file of your project:

        ```php
        <?php
        // app/AppKernel.php

        // ...
        class AppKernel extends Kernel
        {
            public function registerBundles()
            {
                $bundles = array(
                    // ...

                    new <vendor>\<bundle-name>\<bundle-long-name>(),
                );

                // ...
            }

            // ...
        }
        ```

    .. code-block:: rst

        Installation
        ============

        Step 1: Download the Bundle
        ---------------------------

        Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
        following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

        .. code-block:: terminal

            $ composer require <package-name>

        This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
        in the `installation chapter`_ of the Composer documentation.

        Step 2: Enable the Bundle
        -------------------------

        Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
        in the ``app/AppKernel.php`` file of your project:

        .. code-block:: php

            <?php
            // app/AppKernel.php

            // ...
            class AppKernel extends Kernel
            {
                public function registerBundles()
                {
                    $bundles = array(
                        // ...

                        new <vendor>\<bundle-name>\<bundle-long-name>(),
                    );

                    // ...
                }

                // ...
            }

        .. _`installation chapter`: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

The example above assumes that you are installing the latest stable version of
the bundle, where you don't have to provide the package version number
(e.g. ``composer require friendsofsymfony/user-bundle``). If the installation
instructions refer to some past bundle version or to some unstable version,
include the version constraint (e.g. ``composer require friendsofsymfony/user-bundle "~2.0@dev"``).

Optionally, you can add more installation steps (*Step 3*, *Step 4*, etc.) to
explain other required installation tasks, such as registering routes or
dumping assets.

Routing
-------

If the bundle provides routes, they must be prefixed with the bundle alias.
For example, if your bundle is called AcmeBlogBundle, all its routes must be
prefixed with ``acme_blog_``.

Templates
---------

If a bundle provides templates, they must use Twig. A bundle must not provide
a main layout, except if it provides a full working application.

Translation Files
-----------------

If a bundle provides message translations, they must be defined in the XLIFF
format; the domain should be named after the bundle name (``acme_blog``).

A bundle must not override existing messages from another bundle.

Configuration
-------------

To provide more flexibility, a bundle can provide configurable settings by
using the Symfony built-in mechanisms.

For simple configuration settings, rely on the default ``parameters`` entry of
the Symfony configuration. Symfony parameters are simple key/value pairs; a
value being any valid PHP value. Each parameter name should start with the
bundle alias, though this is just a best-practice suggestion. The rest of the
parameter name will use a period (``.``) to separate different parts (e.g.
``acme_blog.author.email``).

The end user can provide values in any configuration file:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        parameters:
            acme_blog.author.email: 'fabien@example.com'

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config.xml -->
        <parameters>
            <parameter key="acme_blog.author.email">fabien@example.com</parameter>
        </parameters>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config.php
        $container->setParameter('acme_blog.author.email', 'fabien@example.com');

Retrieve the configuration parameters in your code from the container::

    $container->getParameter('acme_blog.author.email');

Even if this mechanism is simple enough, you should consider using the more
advanced :doc:`semantic bundle configuration </bundles/configuration>`.

Versioning
----------

Bundles must be versioned following the `Semantic Versioning Standard`_.

Services
--------

If the bundle defines services, they must be prefixed with the bundle alias.
For example, AcmeBlogBundle services must be prefixed with ``acme_blog``.

In addition, services not meant to be used by the application directly, should
be :ref:`defined as private <container-private-services>`.

.. seealso::

    You can learn much more about service loading in bundles reading this article:
    :doc:`How to Load Service Configuration inside a Bundle </bundles/extension>`.

Composer Metadata
-----------------

The ``composer.json`` file should include at least the following metadata:

``name``
    Consists of the vendor and the short bundle name. If you are releasing the
    bundle on your own instead of on behalf of a company, use your personal name
    (e.g. ``johnsmith/blog-bundle``). The bundle short name excludes the vendor
    name and separates each word with an hyphen. For example: ``AcmeBlogBundle``
    is transformed into ``blog-bundle`` and ``AcmeSocialConnectBundle`` is
    transformed into ``social-connect-bundle``.

``description``
    A brief explanation of the purpose of the bundle.

``type``
    Use the ``symfony-bundle`` value.

``license``
    ``MIT`` is the preferred license for Symfony bundles, but you can use any
    other license.

``autoload``
    This information is used by Symfony to load the classes of the bundle. The
    `PSR-4`_ autoload standard is recommended for modern bundles, but `PSR-0`_
    standard is also supported.

In order to make it easier for developers to find your bundle, register it on
`Packagist`_, the official repository for Composer packages.
