It generated a file with quotes: `"src/Entity/\"user\".php"`.

I have this problem with and without quotes.

Maybe it's related to how the shell pass the values, I used `bash` in a Docker container. Terminal is `gnome-terminal`.

@gsylvestre thanks for reporting this. Sadly, we've changed this multiple times:

* In https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/10178 we added the quotes to fix some issues
* In https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/10520 it was proposed to remove the quotes to fix some issues (but we didn't merged because it was solved differently)

So, I'm lost. I don't know if we should add or remove these quotes ðŸ˜…

@gsylvestre Which terminal do you use?

I don't know if `echo` and the Symfony console behaves in the same way but with `bash` in `gnome-terminal`, I have to use quote or escape the backslash in order to have the backslash in the output:

```
$ echo "App\Entity"
App\Entity
$ echo App\Entity
AppEntity
$ echo App\\Entity
App\Entity
```

Oh geez sorry about that.
I was on _cmder_ on Windows 10.
I noticed the `App\\Entity` notation was used on 4.0 docs...

I'll make some tests and come back to you.

Here are the results on Windows 10:

|               |   PHPStorm   |    cmder     |     cmd      |   git bash  | power shell |
|---------------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 'App\Entity'  | 'App\Entity' | 'App\Entity' | 'App\Entity' | ok          | not tested  |
| "App\Entity"  | ok           | ok           | ok           | ok          | ok          |
| App\\\\Entity   | App\\\\Entity  | App\\\\Entity  | App\\\\Entity  | App\\\\Entity | not tested  |
| App\Entity    | ok           | ok           | ok           | AppEntity   | ok          |

`"App\Entity"` would be a winner on Windows.

Any problem with this on other OS/terminal?

afaik double quotes should be fine on Unix based terminals too
