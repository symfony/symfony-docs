@xuanquynh *"you are finished"* is not correct ... but it's widely used and it's *"almost correct"*:

> Also, in proper english usage, "I have finished" is prefered over "I am finished". So, in informal use, you can say "when you are done" and "when you are finished". But the correct forms are "when you have finished" and "when you are through".

In any case, we're going to merge your contribution to change this and avoid further confusion. Thanks!
