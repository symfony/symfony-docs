Hi ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for your contribution! This should be considered a bugfix and target the `3.4` branch of the docs.

The sentence `You can even suppress the name completely by setting it to an empty string::` does not match the following code example, as it does **not** show how to suppress the name, but shows how to **set a custom name** for the form.

Please keep in mind that we are using `AppBundle` and the `Action`-suffix for controller actions.
