Wanna merge it? And where do you think general docs on that env var should go?

I'm not a member of the doc core team. I don't have merge rights on this repo

@dzuelke thanks for this nice improvement and for documenting the `SYMFONY_ENV` usage.

You are right about the necessity of documenting more these variables (there is an opened issue related to this: #4162). However, as this is a quick fix for Heroku, my proposal for doc managers (@weaverryan, @WouterJ and @xabbuh) would be to merge this PR right away and keep #4162 open to discuss more about where and how to document these variables.

I only see some minor issues. Besides that :+1:.

Is this ready for a merge, @weaverryan ?
