Should be updated as the component is now named Messenger.

Yep. I'll go through the PR and re-phrase a bunch of things this weekend.

Not sure its important, but in your PR header:

```diff
- This pull-request adds some documentation for the Message component.
+ This pull-request adds some documentation for the Messenger component.
```

Updated based on feedbacks, split the two documentations (i.e. as a "topic" and as a "component") and added more details. And Travis is green üéâ.

Can I have the honor of another round of reviews?

Ready for another round of reviews üëç

It's ready to be merged. Tweaks can follow in other PRs I suppose.

@boite thank you very much for all your reviews, much appreciated! I've updated the wording of the sentence you highlighted in your last review.

Well done @sroze; this all looks good.
