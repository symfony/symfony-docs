Can `actions/cache` cache only directories and not a single file? Or what I'm doing wrong?

I had to create `.cache` directory to get caching work

Should I also provide PRs for 4.4, 5.0 and master?

@smoench no, don't worry. We merge each PR in all active merges up to `master`. Thanks.

@javiereguiluz I was just asking as the suffix of cache key might has to change to base branch name

~~Please don't merge yet as the base branch resolving doesn't work~~
