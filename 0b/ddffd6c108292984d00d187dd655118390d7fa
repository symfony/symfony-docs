Wouter, will you have the time and motivation of completing this contribution?  I know it's a lot of work ... but if we keep it unmerged, the list of merge conflicts will keep growing ðŸ˜¢

Hi! Is there anything left, other than a rebase to fix the conflicts?

In my opinion this is finished and ready!

Alright, ready to go then :). The merge conflict were fortunately very easy (they all conflicted with the recent diff whitespace changes we made)
