Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.3, 5.4, 6.0.

Cheers!

Thanks @JohJohan! About the label ... we already have `hacktoberfest` as a topic of this repository so, if I'm right, merging this PR will give you the needed attribution without having to add the label too.
