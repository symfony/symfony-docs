But this will fail with Symfony 4 where commands are not auto-disccovered, won't it?

@xabbuh No.... right? Because, we're booting the real kernel and passing it into `Application` (from FrameworkBundle). This simply mirrors what `bin/console` does: https://github.com/symfony/recipes/blob/29e686cb133652385d442df7c178e90907e35b9c/symfony/console/3.3/bin/console#L38

So, we should have the exact commands you'd have in a real app. As long is properly recognized as a command (e.g. autoconfigure or manual wiring), it should be here. Right?

Hey. Assuming the command has been registered as a service, @weaverryan is right here, no need for adding twice to the application as it has been injected during container compilation in the kernel boot process.
This chapter does not include the explicit service definition but includes a mention saying that the command *must* be registered as a service, so I think it's safe to assume it is.
Same for the `kernel->boot()` call, it's indeed not necessary.
👍 all good for me
