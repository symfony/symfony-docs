Actually, the 2.3 did not have a new release since this change was merged. So things will be a bit weird for people reading the 2.3 docs. But well, who is reading the 2.3 installation docs now that the 2.7 LTS is already released?

Which feature do you mean?

@xabbuh the new SE homepage (and the existence of the `/` route rather than the `/app/example` route)

A new 2.3 version will be released "soon" and most newcomers start with 2.7 anyway, so I guess we can safely merge it as it is now.
