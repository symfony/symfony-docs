Thanks Ryan!

I added `Waiting Code Merge` label because I think we need a new release/tag on Encore repository before merging this.

Hello Ryan what about a new page like this one to demonstrate the `enableSvelte` ?
https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html

@zairigimad Yes, probably - but it should also mention https://github.com/symfony/ux/pull/498 and both React and Vue pages need to be updated to mention to mention their UX components as well. I'd love if someone made a PR to the docs for all of that ;)
