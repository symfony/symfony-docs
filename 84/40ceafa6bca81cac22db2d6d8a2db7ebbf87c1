codebase is following the rule (I checked 2.7 branch)
:+1: after fixing punctuation

:+1: this is indeed a rule we apply

I'm thinking how to reword this rule in order to express what we really want, by instance:
"Do not use spaces around offset accessors (``[`` and ``]``), at least that their surrounding expressions are part of another separated expresion."
Otherwise, it can be currently interpreted as `$foo = []` is not good, same for `$foo[] = 'value'` or `$bar = ['foo' => ['baz]]`.

> Otherwise, it can be currently interpreted as `$foo = []`

here braces are not offset accessors, they are short array syntax

> $foo[] = 'value'

here, indeed, should be no spaces except space after `]`.

> `$bar = ['foo' => ['baz]]`

again short array syntax

----------------

so in general, sth like:
`Do not use spaces around `[` offset accessor and before `]` offset accessor.`
