Hi @HeahDude
i think you know what i'm talking about here ;)

i've wondered if this would need a `configuration-block` and if we have to list all the other way to configure this, but i think it's really specific to the annotation...
what do you think ?

I wonder if it would not be easier to expand the code example that we have in the "Basic usage" section to also contain choices coming from a constant and adding an inline comment there.

@xabbuh's comment is a legitimate consideration ü§î
