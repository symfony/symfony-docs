@weaverryan Could this be reviewed and merged fast as Microsoft want to talk about it on Monday during a PHP conference? Thanks.

I guess a new entry should be added to ``redirection_map`` for the ``/cookbook/deployment-tools.rst`` file.

It would be very nice to see also entries from ServerGrove cc/ @pgodel here
same as a very extensive entry for AWS deployment! :+1:

There is nothing special about deploying in ServerGrove, we try to have our
platform be as standard as possible so documents like this are not needed.

I would say a more generic shared hosting / VPS guide would be more useful,
or maybe guides using the various tools out there like capifony,
magallanes, ansible, etc. We have switched from capifony to ansible and
would be willing to write an entry on ansible  if there is interest.
