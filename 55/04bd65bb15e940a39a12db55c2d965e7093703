I'm sorry but I can't see why this change is needed. In the original article it was called `acme.foo.action`? I can't find it.

In the current version the article is not consistent regarding the name of the event between the first one and the last one used in the "Connecting Listeners" section.

First called `acme.action` it is renamed to `foo.action` into and after the comment.

About renaming it to `acme.foo.action`, take a look in the comments of the commit #7547 where @HeahDude offer to use a pattern as __"{vendor}.{context}.{action}"__.
