Maybe we should add something about the `symfony-bundle` Composer package type?

@WouterJ I've added a new section with suggestions for Composer and I've rebased the PR.

Other best practices for shared bundles IMO:

- following semver
- being registered on Packagist

This also fixes https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/4335

@javiereguiluz There is one minor issue with the list syntax and it seems that the installation instructions for the rst format got lost when rebasing. Besides these two things the PR looks great! :+1:

@xabbuh I'm really sorry for having lost some information during the rebase :(  I really wish I haven't lost anything else during the rebase. Thanks for your help!
