I would like to reorder this, first would make the `ExceptionListenerPass`, then register it :) Thanks @ndench

@yceruto yeah I thought about ordering it that way, it makes more sense to implement as well because you get autocompletion from your IDE, I only went this way to be consistent with how it was before. I'm happy to reorder though, if we're not worried about keeping the same order as before?

Also, do you know why platformsh is failing? I get a 404 from the link.

Reordering indeed was a good move. :)

Ok I've done the reordering, it does seem more intuitive.
