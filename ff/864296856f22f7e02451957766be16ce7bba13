@javiereguiluz you can also add a pointer without headline:

```rst
.. _community-releases-version-table:

==== ===== ====
...
```

And then use that as anchor. I don't think it's really needed to put the table in a seperate section.

@WouterJ I don't mind either solution, but let's try to fix this soon because the link that points to this non-existent anchor is already published in http://symfony.com/roadmap page:
