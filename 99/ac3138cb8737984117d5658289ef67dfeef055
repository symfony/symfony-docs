Thank you very much!

@OskarStark I will do it, but maybe should I wait until sf 4.4 lts is out, so will be more "stable" images?

No letâ€™s use them for 4.3 now and maybe update them later for 4.4

@OskarStark here you go

note that i had to create a project with `symfony new sf43 --version=4.3 --full --debug` (note the `--full`) to have the wdt (i do not know if we should document it or not)

images are also compressed a little bit as requested

cheers
