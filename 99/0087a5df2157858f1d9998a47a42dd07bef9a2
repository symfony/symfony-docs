@gnito-org thanks for this contribution!

I see that you created the PR against 5.3 and then changed the base to 4.4 using GitHub's interface. That sadly doesn't work ... but don't worry, the tool we use to merge PRs can rebase before merging, so we'll rebase this to 4.4. ourselves while merging. Thanks a lot!
