What about this point?

A trait is not part of a type, thus we don't know what contract it implements: maybe an interface/the parent of the class that uses the trait actually declared the optional argument. Removing it would be a BC break. Since we cannot know, we cannot remove these arguments.

Should we add a note to explain this? Probably in another PR...
