This article is about using the Sessions outside of the Symfony2 framework. It shouldn't cause any problems then. So I'm -1 for this change.

However, we might need to add a `.. caution::` box saying that initializing the Session object causes the session to be started, which can lead to unexpected errors.

Sorry about that - I misunderstood the context of the page. Thanks for looking at this, I have removed my changes and added a caution box instead :-)
