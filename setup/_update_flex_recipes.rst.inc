Upgrading Flex Recipes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some :doc:`Flex Recipes </setup/flex>` for packages you've already installed may
also be out of date. You don't need to update these, but it's a great way to keep
your code updated with the latest features and conventions.

See :ref:`updating-recipes` for details.
