Christopher, thanks for this proposal!

~I think it's a good idea because, in a real app, this table will be accessed a lot. However, looking at PdoSession class, all `SELECT` and `UPDATE` queries use the `id` column as the only `WHERE` clause. Should we create the index on that column instead? I don't know, so I'm just asking.~

Sorry ... I misread the description of your PR, so everything I said is wrong. Let's forget it ðŸ˜Š

Before merging I'll wait for others to review this. Thanks!
