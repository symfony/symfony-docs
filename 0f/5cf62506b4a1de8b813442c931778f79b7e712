As expected, this failed:

```
Executing build hook...
    Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './platform/requirements.txt'
    make: sphinx-build: Command not found
    make: *** [html] Error 127

No luck with the updated file path:

```
 Executing build hook...
    Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/.platform/requirements.txt'
    make: sphinx-build: Command not found
    make: *** [html] Error 127
```

Any other idea or should we close this?

Another fail in the last attempt:

```
Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../.platform/requirements.txt'
```

@damz do you know if it's possible to more the `requirements.txt` file to the `.platform/` directory and reference it in the `.platform.app.yaml` file. We've tried all kinds of file paths but none worked. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz You can just use what I'd done in #7402

... and it worked ðŸŽ‰  @robfrawley thanks! You saved us!

I still feel strongly that both Travis and Platform build using the same procedure (short of the special Travis flags): https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/7402/files#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3R9 :-)

Can we merge this? It's a minor change but it will help us remove this internal file. Thanks!
