Forms
=====

Forms are one of the most misused Symfony components due to its vast scope and
endless list of features. In this chapter we'll show you some of the best
practices so you can leverage forms but get work done quickly.

Building Forms
--------------

.. best-practice::

    Define your forms as PHP classes.

The Form component allows you to build forms right inside your controller
code. This is perfectly fine if you don't need to reuse the form somewhere else.
But for organization and reuse, we recommend that you define each
form in its own PHP class::

    namespace AppBundle\Form;

    use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\OptionsResolver\OptionsResolver;

    class PostType extends AbstractType
    {
        public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
        {
            $builder
                ->add('title')
                ->add('summary', 'textarea')
                ->add('content', 'textarea')
                ->add('authorEmail', 'email')
                ->add('publishedAt', 'datetime')
            ;
        }

        public function configureOptions(OptionsResolver $resolver)
        {
            $resolver->setDefaults(array(
                'data_class' => 'AppBundle\Entity\Post'
            ));
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return 'post';
        }
    }

To use the class, use ``createForm`` and instantiate the new class::

    use AppBundle\Form\PostType;
    // ...

    public function newAction(Request $request)
    {
        $post = new Post();
        $form = $this->createForm(new PostType(), $post);

        // ...
    }

Registering Forms as Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also
:ref:`register your form type as a service <form-cookbook-form-field-service>`.
But this is *not* recommended unless you plan to reuse the new form type in many
places or embed it in other forms directly or via the
:doc:`collection type </reference/forms/types/collection>`.

For most forms that are used only to edit or create something, registering
the form as a service is over-kill, and makes it more difficult to figure
out exactly which form class is being used in a controller.

Form Button Configuration
-------------------------

Form classes should try to be agnostic to *where* they will be used. This
makes them easier to re-use later.

.. best-practice::

    Add buttons in the templates, not in the form classes or the controllers.

Since Symfony 2.5, you can add buttons as fields on your form. This is a nice
way to simplify the template that renders your form. But if you add the buttons
directly in your form class, this would effectively limit the scope of that form:

.. code-block:: php

    class PostType extends AbstractType
    {
        public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
        {
            $builder
                // ...
                ->add('save', 'submit', array('label' => 'Create Post'))
            ;
        }

        // ...
    }

This form *may* have been designed for creating posts, but if you wanted
to reuse it for editing posts, the button label would be wrong. Instead,
some developers configure form buttons in the controller::

    namespace AppBundle\Controller\Admin;

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
    use AppBundle\Entity\Post;
    use AppBundle\Form\PostType;

    class PostController extends Controller
    {
        // ...

        public function newAction(Request $request)
        {
            $post = new Post();
            $form = $this->createForm(new PostType(), $post);
            $form->add('submit', 'submit', array(
                'label' => 'Create',
                'attr'  => array('class' => 'btn btn-default pull-right')
            ));

            // ...
        }
    }

This is also an important error, because you are mixing presentation markup
(labels, CSS classes, etc.) with pure PHP code. Separation of concerns is
always a good practice to follow, so put all the view-related things in the
view layer:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {{ form_start(form) }}
        {{ form_widget(form) }}

        <input type="submit" value="Create"
               class="btn btn-default pull-right" />
    {{ form_end(form) }}

Rendering the Form
------------------

There are a lot of ways to render your form, ranging from rendering the entire
thing in one line to rendering each part of each field independently. The
best way depends on how much customization you need.

One of the simplest ways - which is especially useful during development -
is to render the form tags and use ``form_widget()`` to render all of the
fields:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {{ form_start(form, {'attr': {'class': 'my-form-class'} }) }}
        {{ form_widget(form) }}
    {{ form_end(form) }}

If you need more control over how your fields are rendered, then you should
remove the ``form_widget(form)`` function and render your fields individually.
See the :doc:`/cookbook/form/form_customization` article for more information
on this and how you can control *how* the form renders at a global level
using form theming.

Handling Form Submits
---------------------

Handling a form submit usually follows a similar template:

.. code-block:: php

    public function newAction(Request $request)
    {
        // build the form ...

        $form->handleRequest($request);

        if ($form->isSubmitted() && $form->isValid()) {
            $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
            $em->persist($post);
            $em->flush();

            return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl(
                'admin_post_show',
                array('id' => $post->getId())
            ));
        }

        // render the template
    }

There are really only two notable things here. First, we recommend that you
use a single action for both rendering the form and handling the form submit.
For example, you *could* have a ``newAction`` that *only* renders the form
and a ``createAction`` that *only* processes the form submit. Both those
actions will be almost identical. So it's much simpler to let ``newAction``
handle everything.

Second, we recommend using ``$form->isSubmitted()`` in the ``if`` statement
for clarity. This isn't technically needed, since ``isValid()`` first calls
``isSubmitted()``. But without this, the flow doesn't read well as it *looks*
like the form is *always* processed (even on the GET request).

Custom Form Field Types
-----------------------

.. best-practice::

    Add the ``app_`` prefix to your custom form field types to avoid collisions.

Custom form field types inherit from the ``AbstractType`` class, which defines the
``getName()`` method to configure the name of that form type. These names must
be unique in the application.

If a custom form type uses the same name as any of the Symfony's built-in form
types, it will override it. The same happens when the custom form type matches
any of the types defined by the third-party bundles installed in your application.

Add the ``app_`` prefix to your custom form field types to avoid name collisions
that can lead to hard to debug errors.
