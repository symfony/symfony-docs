   single: Symfony Framework Best Practices

The Symfony Framework Best Practices
====================================

The Symfony framework is well-known for being *really* flexible and is used
to build micro-sites, enterprise applications that handle billions of connections
and even as the basis for *other* frameworks. Since its release in July 2011,
the community has learned a lot about what's possible and how to do things *best*.

These community resources - like blog posts or presentations - have created
an unofficial set of recommendations for developing Symfony applications.
Unfortunately, a lot of these recommendations are unneeded for web applications.
Much of the time, they unnecessarily overcomplicate things and don't follow the
original pragmatic philosophy of Symfony.

What is this Guide About?
-------------------------

This guide aims to fix that by describing the **best practices for developing
web apps with the Symfony full-stack framework**. These are best practices that
fit the philosophy of the framework as envisioned by its original creator
`Fabien Potencier`_.

.. note::

    **Best practice** is a noun that means *"a well defined procedure that is
    known to produce near-optimum results"*. And that's exactly what this
    guide aims to provide. Even if you don't agree with every recommendation,
    we believe these will help you build great applications with less complexity.

This guide is **specially suited** for:

* Websites and web applications developed with the full-stack Symfony framework.

For other situations, this guide might be a good **starting point** that you can
then **extend and fit to your specific needs**:

* Bundles shared publicly to the Symfony community;
* Advanced developers or teams who have created their own standards;
* Some complex applications that have highly customized requirements;
* Bundles that may be shared internally within a company.

We know that old habits die hard and some of you will be shocked by some
of these best practices. But by following these, you'll be able to develop
apps faster, with less complexity and with the same or even higher quality.
It's also a moving target that will continue to improve.

Keep in mind that these are **optional recommendations** that you and your
team may or may not follow to develop Symfony applications. If you want to
continue using your own best practices and methodologies, you can of course
do it. Symfony is flexible enough to adapt to your needs. That will never
change.

Who this Book Is for (Hint: It's not a Tutorial)
------------------------------------------------

Any Symfony developer, whether you are an expert or a newcomer, can read this
guide. But since this isn't a tutorial, you'll need some basic knowledge of
Symfony to follow everything. If you are totally new to Symfony, welcome!
Start with :doc:`The Quick Tour </quick_tour/the_big_picture>` tutorial first.

We've deliberately kept this guide short. We won't repeat explanations that
you can find in the vast Symfony documentation, like discussions about dependency
injection or front controllers. We'll solely focus on explaining how to do
what you already know.

The Application
---------------

In addition to this guide, you'll find a sample application developed with
all these best practices in mind. **The application is a simple blog engine**,
because that will allow us to focus on the Symfony concepts and features without
getting buried in difficult details.

Instead of developing the application step by step in this guide, you'll find
selected snippets of code through the chapters. Please refer to the last chapter
of this guide to find more details about this application and the instructions
to install it.

Don't Update Your Existing Applications
---------------------------------------

After reading this handbook, some of you may be considering refactoring your
existing Symfony applications. Our recommendation is sound and clear: **you
should not refactor your existing applications to comply with these best
practices**. The reasons for not doing it are various:

* Your existing applications are not wrong, they just follow another set of
  guidelines;
* A full codebase refactorization is prone to introduce errors in your
  applications;
* The amount of work spent on this could be better dedicated to improving
  your tests or adding features that provide real value to the end users.
