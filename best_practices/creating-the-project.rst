Creating the Project
====================

Installing Symfony
------------------

In the past, Symfony projects were created with `Composer`_, the dependency manager
for PHP applications. However, the current recommendation is to use the **Symfony
Installer**, which has to be installed before creating your first project.

.. best-practice::

    Use the Symfony Installer to create new Symfony-based projects.

Read the :doc:`installation chapter </book/installation>` of the Symfony Book to
learn how to install and use the Symfony Installer.

Creating the Blog Application
-----------------------------

Now that everything is correctly set up, you can create a new project based on
Symfony. In your command console, browse to a directory where you have permission
to create files and execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd projects/
    $ symfony new blog

    # Windows
    c:\> cd projects/
    c:\projects\> php symfony new blog

.. note::

    If the installer doesn't work for you or doesn't output anything, make sure
    that the `Phar extension`_ is installed and enabled on your computer.

This command creates a new directory called ``blog`` that contains a fresh new
project based on the most recent stable Symfony version available. In addition,
the installer checks if your system meets the technical requirements to execute
Symfony applications. If not, you'll see the list of changes needed to meet those
requirements.

.. tip::

    Symfony releases are digitally signed for security reasons. If you want to
    verify the integrity of your Symfony installation, take a look at the
    `public checksums repository`_ and follow `these steps`_ to verify the
    signatures.

Structuring the Application
---------------------------

After creating the application, enter the ``blog/`` directory and you'll see a
number of files and directories generated automatically:

.. code-block:: text

    blog/
    ├─ app/
    │  ├─ config/
    │  └─ Resources/
    ├─ bin
    │  └─ console
    ├─ src/
    │  └─ AppBundle/
    ├─ var/
    │  ├─ cache/
    │  ├─ logs/
    │  └─ sessions/
    ├─ tests/
    │  └─ AppBundle/
    ├─ vendor/
    └─ web/

This file and directory hierarchy is the convention proposed by Symfony to
structure your applications. The recommended purpose of each directory is the
following:

* ``app/config/``, stores all the configuration defined for any environment;
* ``app/Resources/``, stores all the templates and the translation files for the
  application;
* ``src/AppBundle/``, stores the Symfony specific code (controllers and routes),
  your domain code (e.g. Doctrine classes) and all your business logic;
* ``var/cache/``, stores all the cache files generated by the application;
* ``var/logs/``, stores all the log files generated by the application;
* ``var/sessions/``, stores all the session files generated by the application;
* ``tests/AppBundle/``, stores the automatic tests (e.g. Unit tests) of the
  application.
* ``vendor/``, this is the directory where Composer installs the application's
  dependencies and you should never modify any of its contents;
* ``web/``, stores all the front controller files and all the web assets, such
  as stylesheets, JavaScript files and images.

Application Bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Symfony 2.0 was released, most developers naturally adopted the symfony
1.x way of dividing applications into logical modules. That's why many Symfony
apps use bundles to divide their code into logical features: UserBundle,
ProductBundle, InvoiceBundle, etc.

But a bundle is *meant* to be something that can be reused as a stand-alone
piece of software. If UserBundle cannot be used *"as is"* in other Symfony
apps, then it shouldn't be its own bundle. Moreover, if InvoiceBundle depends on
ProductBundle, then there's no advantage to having two separate bundles.

.. best-practice::

    Create only one bundle called AppBundle for your application logic

Implementing a single AppBundle bundle in your projects will make your code
more concise and easier to understand. Starting in Symfony 2.6, the official
Symfony documentation uses the AppBundle name.

.. note::

    There is no need to prefix the AppBundle with your own vendor (e.g.
    AcmeAppBundle), because this application bundle is never going to be
    shared.

.. note::

    Another reason to create a new bundle is when you're overriding something
    in a vendor's bundle (e.g. a controller). See :doc:`/cookbook/bundles/inheritance`.

All in all, this is the typical directory structure of a Symfony application
that follows these best practices:

.. code-block:: text

    blog/
    ├─ app/
    │  ├─ config/
    │  └─ Resources/
    ├─ bin/
    │  └─ console
    ├─ src/
    │  └─ AppBundle/
    ├─ tests/
    │  └─ AppBundle/
    ├─ var/
    │  ├─ cache/
    │  ├─ logs/
       └─ sessions/
    ├─ vendor/
    └─ web/
       ├─ app.php
       └─ app_dev.php

.. tip::

    If your Symfony installation doesn't come with a pre-generated AppBundle,
    you can generate it by hand executing this command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php bin/console generate:bundle --namespace=AppBundle --dir=src --format=annotation --no-interaction

Extending the Directory Structure
---------------------------------

If your project or infrastructure requires some changes to the default directory
structure of Symfony, you can
:doc:`override the location of the main directories </cookbook/configuration/override_dir_structure>`:
``cache/``, ``logs/`` and ``web/``.
