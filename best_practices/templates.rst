Templates
=========

When PHP was created 20 years ago, developers loved its simplicity and how
well it blended HTML and dynamic code. But as time passed, other template
languages - like `Twig`_ - were created to make templating even better.

.. best-practice::

    Use Twig templating format for your templates.

Generally speaking, PHP templates are much more verbose than Twig templates because
they lack native support for lots of modern features needed by templates,
like inheritance, automatic escaping and named arguments for filters and
functions.

Twig is the default templating format in Symfony and has the largest community
support of all non-PHP template engines (it's used in high profile projects
such as Drupal 8).

In addition, Twig is the only template format with guaranteed support in Symfony
3.0. As a matter of fact, PHP may be removed from the officially supported
template engines.

Template Locations
------------------

.. best-practice::

    Store all your application's templates in ``app/Resources/views/`` directory.

Traditionally, Symfony developers stored the application templates in the
``Resources/views/`` directory of each bundle. Then they used the logical name
to refer to them (e.g. ``AcmeDemoBundle:Default:index.html.twig``).

But for the templates used in your application, it's much more convenient
to store them in the ``app/Resources/views/`` directory. For starters, this
drastically simplifies their logical names:

=================================================  ==================================
Templates Stored inside Bundles                    Templates Stored in ``app/``
=================================================  ==================================
``AcmeDemoBundle:Default:index.html.twig``         ``default/index.html.twig``
``::layout.html.twig``                             ``layout.html.twig``
``AcmeDemoBundle::index.html.twig``                ``index.html.twig``
``AcmeDemoBundle:Default:subdir/index.html.twig``  ``default/subdir/index.html.twig``
``AcmeDemoBundle:Default/subdir:index.html.twig``  ``default/subdir/index.html.twig``
=================================================  ==================================

Another advantage is that centralizing your templates simplifies the work
of your designers. They don't need to look for templates in lots of directories
scattered through lots of bundles.

.. best-practice::

    Use lowercased snake_case for directory and template names.

Twig Extensions
---------------

.. best-practice::

    Define your Twig extensions in the ``AppBundle/Twig/`` directory and
    configure them using the ``app/config/services.yml`` file.

Our application needs a custom ``md2html`` Twig filter so that we can transform
the Markdown contents of each post into HTML.

To do this, first, install the excellent `Parsedown`_ Markdown parser as
a new dependency of the project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require erusev/parsedown

Then, create a new ``Markdown`` service that will be used later by the Twig
extension. The service definition only requires the path to the class:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/services.yml
    services:
        # ...
        markdown:
            class: AppBundle\Utils\Markdown

And the ``Markdown`` class just needs to define one single method to transform
Markdown content into HTML::

    namespace AppBundle\Utils;

    class Markdown
    {
        private $parser;

        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->parser = new \Parsedown();
        }

        public function toHtml($text)
        {
            $html = $this->parser->text($text);

            return $html;
        }
    }

Next, create a new Twig extension and define a new filter called ``md2html``
using the ``Twig_SimpleFilter`` class. Inject the newly defined ``markdown``
service in the constructor of the Twig extension:

.. code-block:: php

    namespace AppBundle\Twig;

    use AppBundle\Utils\Markdown;

    class AppExtension extends \Twig_Extension
    {
        private $parser;

        public function __construct(Markdown $parser)
        {
            $this->parser = $parser;
        }

        public function getFilters()
        {
            return array(
                new \Twig_SimpleFilter(
                    'md2html',
                    array($this, 'markdownToHtml'),
                    array('is_safe' => array('html'))
                ),
            );
        }

        public function markdownToHtml($content)
        {
            return $this->parser->toHtml($content);
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return 'app_extension';
        }
    }

Lastly define a new service to enable this Twig extension in the app (the service
name is irrelevant because you never use it in your own code):

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/services.yml
    services:
        app.twig.app_extension:
            class:     AppBundle\Twig\AppExtension
            arguments: ["@markdown"]
            public:    false
            tags:
                - { name: twig.extension }
