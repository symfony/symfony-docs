@nicoweb This looks good. üëç But could you also update the XML and PHP config examples?

This is correct according to the latest recipe: https://github.com/symfony/recipes/blob/3b19bd94886555df1997b441b6cf6a1fab088f3a/symfony/framework-bundle/4.2/config/services.yaml#L18

Thanks @nicoweb.

Please note, that `Kernel.php` is also missing in the XML and PHP definitions üòÉ
