Hi üëã

First of all: your change looks correct, also the target branch üëç

There were a lot of changes around this variable in the last time:
* https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/11394
* https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/11781
* https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/11887

However I don't now why we should name it `$dateCallback`, I prefer `$callback` (in the whole example of course).

@wouterj is there any reason I can get, to name it `$dateCallback`?

Hi @OskarStark ,

Thanks for your reply, i propose this change especially to make example working. Actually the variable name isn't the same at creation (`$callback`) and at use (`$dateCallback`).

I choose to keep the "use" version (`$dateCallback`) because i consider it more descriptive but that's not the main purpose of my PR.
