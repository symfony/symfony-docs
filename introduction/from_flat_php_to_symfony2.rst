Symfony versus Flat PHP
=======================

**Why is Symfony better than just opening up a file and writing flat PHP?**

If you've never used a PHP framework, aren't familiar with the
`Model-View-Controller`_ (MVC) philosophy, or just wonder what all the *hype*
is around Symfony, this article is for you. Instead of *telling* you that
Symfony allows you to develop faster and better software than with flat PHP,
you'll see for yourself.

In this article, you'll write a simple application in flat PHP, and then
refactor it to be more organized. You'll travel through time, seeing the
decisions behind why web development has evolved over the past several years
to where it is now.

By the end, you'll see how Symfony can rescue you from mundane tasks and
let you take back control of your code.

A Simple Blog in Flat PHP
-------------------------

In this article, you'll build the token blog application using only flat PHP.
To begin, create a single page that displays blog entries that have been
persisted to the database. Writing in flat PHP is quick and dirty:

.. code-block:: html+php

    <?php
    // index.php
    $link = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=blog_db", 'myuser', 'mypassword');

    $result = $link->query('SELECT id, title FROM post');
    ?>

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>List of Posts</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>List of Posts</h1>
            <ul>
                <?php while ($row = $result->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)): ?>
                <li>
                    <a href="/show.php?id=<?= $row['id'] ?>">
                        <?= $row['title'] ?>
                    </a>
                </li>
                <?php endwhile ?>
            </ul>
        </body>
    </html>

    <?php
    $link = null;
    ?>

That's quick to write, fast to execute, and, as your app grows, impossible
to maintain. There are several problems that need to be addressed:

* **No error-checking**: What if the connection to the database fails?

* **Poor organization**: If the application grows, this single file will become
  increasingly unmaintainable. Where should you put code to handle a form
  submission? How can you validate data? Where should code go for sending
  emails?

* **Difficult to reuse code**: Since everything is in one file, there's no
  way to reuse any part of the application for other "pages" of the blog.

.. note::

    Another problem not mentioned here is the fact that the database is
    tied to MySQL. Though not covered here, Symfony fully integrates `Doctrine`_,
    a library dedicated to database abstraction and mapping.

Isolating the Presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code can immediately gain from separating the application "logic" from
the code that prepares the HTML "presentation"::

    // index.php
    $link = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=blog_db", 'myuser', 'mypassword');

    $result = $link->query('SELECT id, title FROM post');

    $posts = array();
    while ($row = $result->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
        $posts[] = $row;
    }

    $link = null;

    // include the HTML presentation code
    require 'templates/list.php';


The HTML code is now stored in a separate file ``templates/list.php``, which
is primarily an HTML file that uses a template-like PHP syntax:

.. code-block:: html+php

    <!-- templates/list.php -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>List of Posts</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>List of Posts</h1>
            <ul>
                <?php foreach ($posts as $post): ?>
                <li>
                    <a href="/show.php?id=<?= $post['id'] ?>">
                        <?= $post['title'] ?>
                    </a>
                </li>
                <?php endforeach ?>
            </ul>
        </body>
    </html>

By convention, the file that contains all the application logic - ``index.php`` -
is known as a "controller". The term controller is a word you'll hear a lot,
regardless of the language or framework you use. It refers simply to the area
of *your* code that processes user input and prepares the response.

In this case, the controller prepares data from the database and then includes
a template to present that data. With the controller isolated, you could
easily change *just* the template file if you needed to render the blog
entries in some other format (e.g. ``list.json.php`` for JSON format).

Isolating the Application (Domain) Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far the application contains only one page. But what if a second page
needed to use the same database connection, or even the same array of blog
posts? Refactor the code so that the core behavior and data-access functions
of the application are isolated in a new file called ``model.php``::

    // model.php
    function open_database_connection()
    {
        $link = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=blog_db", 'myuser', 'mypassword');

        return $link;
    }

    function close_database_connection(&$link)
    {
        $link = null;
    }

    function get_all_posts()
    {
        $link = open_database_connection();

        $result = $link->query('SELECT id, title FROM post');

        $posts = array();
        while ($row = $result->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
            $posts[] = $row;
        }
        close_database_connection($link);

        return $posts;
    }

.. tip::

   The filename ``model.php`` is used because the logic and data access of
   an application is traditionally known as the "model" layer. In a well-organized
   application, the majority of the code representing your "business logic"
   should live in the model (as opposed to living in a controller). And unlike
   in this example, only a portion (or none) of the model is actually concerned
   with accessing a database.

The controller (``index.php``) is now very simple::

    // index.php
    require_once 'model.php';

    $posts = get_all_posts();

    require 'templates/list.php';

Now, the sole task of the controller is to get data from the model layer of
the application (the model) and to call a template to render that data.
This is a very simple example of the model-view-controller pattern.

Isolating the Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, the application has been refactored into three distinct pieces
offering various advantages and the opportunity to reuse almost everything
on different pages.

The only part of the code that *can't* be reused is the page layout. Fix
that by creating a new ``templates/layout.php`` file:

.. code-block:: html+php

    <!-- templates/layout.php -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title><?= $title ?></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <?= $content ?>
        </body>
    </html>

The template ``templates/list.php`` can now be simplified to "extend"
the ``templates/layout.php``:

.. code-block:: html+php

    <!-- templates/list.php -->
    <?php $title = 'List of Posts' ?>

    <?php ob_start() ?>
        <h1>List of Posts</h1>
        <ul>
            <?php foreach ($posts as $post): ?>
            <li>
                <a href="/show.php?id=<?= $post['id'] ?>">
                    <?= $post['title'] ?>
                </a>
            </li>
            <?php endforeach ?>
        </ul>
    <?php $content = ob_get_clean() ?>

    <?php include 'layout.php' ?>

You now have a setup that will allow you to reuse the layout.
Unfortunately, to accomplish this, you're forced to use a few ugly
PHP functions (``ob_start()``, ``ob_get_clean()``) in the template. Symfony
uses a :doc:`Templating </components/templating>` component
that allows this to be accomplished cleanly and easily. You'll see it in
action shortly.

Adding a Blog "show" Page
-------------------------

The blog "list" page has now been refactored so that the code is better-organized
and reusable. To prove it, add a blog "show" page, which displays an individual
blog post identified by an ``id`` query parameter.

To begin, create a new function in the ``model.php`` file that retrieves
an individual blog result based on a given id::

    // model.php
    function get_post_by_id($id)
    {
        $link = open_database_connection();

        $query = 'SELECT created_at, title, body FROM post WHERE  id=:id';
        $statement = $link->prepare($query);
        $statement->bindValue(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $statement->execute();

        $row = $statement->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

        close_database_connection($link);

        return $row;
    }

Next, create a new file called ``show.php`` - the controller for this new
page::

    // show.php
    require_once 'model.php';

    $post = get_post_by_id($_GET['id']);

    require 'templates/show.php';

Finally, create the new template file - ``templates/show.php`` - to render
the individual blog post:

.. code-block:: html+php

    <!-- templates/show.php -->
    <?php $title = $post['title'] ?>

    <?php ob_start() ?>
        <h1><?= $post['title'] ?></h1>

        <div class="date"><?= $post['created_at'] ?></div>
        <div class="body">
            <?= $post['body'] ?>
        </div>
    <?php $content = ob_get_clean() ?>

    <?php include 'layout.php' ?>

Creating the second page is now very easy and no code is duplicated. Still,
this page introduces even more lingering problems that a framework can solve
for you. For example, a missing or invalid ``id`` query parameter will cause
the page to crash. It would be better if this caused a 404 page to be rendered,
but this can't really be done easily yet.

Another major problem is that each individual controller file must include
the ``model.php`` file. What if each controller file suddenly needed to include
an additional file or perform some other global task (e.g. enforce security)?
As it stands now, that code would need to be added to every controller file.
If you forget to include something in one file, hopefully it doesn't relate
to security...

.. _from_flat_php-front-controller:

A "Front Controller" to the Rescue
----------------------------------

The solution is to use a front controller: a single PHP file through which
*all* requests are processed. With a front controller, the URIs for the
application change slightly, but start to become more flexible:

.. code-block:: text

    Without a front controller
    /index.php          => Blog post list page (index.php executed)
    /show.php           => Blog post show page (show.php executed)

    With index.php as the front controller
    /index.php          => Blog post list page (index.php executed)
    /index.php/show     => Blog post show page (index.php executed)

.. include:: /_includes/_rewrite_rule_tip.rst.inc

When using a front controller, a single PHP file (``index.php`` in this case)
renders *every* request. For the blog post show page, ``/index.php/show`` will
actually execute the ``index.php`` file, which is now responsible for routing
requests internally based on the full URI. As you'll see, a front controller
is a very powerful tool.

Creating the Front Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're about to take a **big** step with the application. With one file handling
all requests, you can centralize things such as security handling, configuration
loading, and routing. In this application, ``index.php`` must now be smart
enough to render the blog post list page *or* the blog post show page based
on the requested URI::

    // index.php

    // load and initialize any global libraries
    require_once 'model.php';
    require_once 'controllers.php';

    // route the request internally
    $uri = parse_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], PHP_URL_PATH);
    if ('/index.php' === $uri) {
        list_action();
    } elseif ('/index.php/show' === $uri && isset($_GET['id'])) {
        show_action($_GET['id']);
    } else {
        header('HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found');
        echo '<html><body><h1>Page Not Found</h1></body></html>';
    }

For organization, both controllers (formerly ``/index.php`` and ``/index.php/show``)
are now PHP functions and each has been moved into a separate file named ``controllers.php``::

    // controllers.php
    function list_action()
    {
        $posts = get_all_posts();
        require 'templates/list.php';
    }

    function show_action($id)
    {
        $post = get_post_by_id($id);
        require 'templates/show.php';
    }

As a front controller, ``index.php`` has taken on an entirely new role, one
that includes loading the core libraries and routing the application so that
one of the two controllers (the ``list_action()`` and ``show_action()``
functions) is called. In reality, the front controller is beginning to look and
act a lot like how Symfony handles and routes requests.

But be careful not to confuse the terms *front controller* and *controller*. Your
app will usually have just *one* front controller, which boots your code. You will
have *many* controller functions: one for each page.

.. tip::

   Another advantage of a front controller is flexible URLs. Notice that
   the URL to the blog post show page could be changed from ``/show`` to ``/read``
   by changing code in only one location. Before, an entire file needed to
   be renamed. In Symfony, URLs are even more flexible.

By now, the application has evolved from a single PHP file into a structure
that is organized and allows for code reuse. You should be happier, but far
from satisfied. For example, the routing system is fickle, and wouldn't
recognize that the list page - ``/index.php``  - should be accessible also via ``/``
(if Apache rewrite rules were added). Also, instead of developing the blog,
a lot of time is being spent working on the "architecture" of the code (e.g.
routing, calling controllers, templates, etc.). More time will need to be
spent to handle form submissions, input validation, logging and security.
Why should you have to reinvent solutions to all these routine problems?

.. _add-a-touch-of-symfony2:

Add a Touch of Symfony
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symfony to the rescue. Before actually using Symfony, you need to download
it. This can be done by using `Composer`_, which takes care of downloading the
correct version and all its dependencies and provides an autoloader. An
autoloader is a tool that makes it possible to start using PHP classes
without explicitly including the file containing the class.

In your root directory, create a ``composer.json`` file with the following
content:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "symfony/symfony": "3.1.*"
        },
        "autoload": {
            "files": ["model.php","controllers.php"]
        }
    }

Next, `download Composer`_ and then run the following command, which will download Symfony
into a ``vendor/`` directory:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer install

Beside downloading your dependencies, Composer generates a ``vendor/autoload.php`` file,
which takes care of autoloading for all the files in the Symfony Framework as well as
the files mentioned in the autoload section of your ``composer.json``.

Core to Symfony's philosophy is the idea that an application's main job is
to interpret each request and return a response. To this end, Symfony provides
both a :class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request` and a
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Response` class. These classes are
object-oriented representations of the raw HTTP request being processed and
the HTTP response being returned. Use them to improve the blog::

    // index.php
    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();

    $uri = $request->getPathInfo();
    if ('/' === $uri) {
        $response = list_action();
    } elseif ('/show' === $uri && $request->query->has('id')) {
        $response = show_action($request->query->get('id'));
    } else {
        $html = '<html><body><h1>Page Not Found</h1></body></html>';
        $response = new Response($html, Response::HTTP_NOT_FOUND);
    }

    // echo the headers and send the response
    $response->send();

The controllers are now responsible for returning a ``Response`` object.
To make this easier, you can add a new ``render_template()`` function, which,
incidentally, acts quite a bit like the Symfony templating engine::

    // controllers.php
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    function list_action()
    {
        $posts = get_all_posts();
        $html = render_template('templates/list.php', array('posts' => $posts));

        return new Response($html);
    }

    function show_action($id)
    {
        $post = get_post_by_id($id);
        $html = render_template('templates/show.php', array('post' => $post));

        return new Response($html);
    }

    // helper function to render templates
    function render_template($path, array $args)
    {
        extract($args);
        ob_start();
        require $path;
        $html = ob_get_clean();

        return $html;
    }

By bringing in a small part of Symfony, the application is more flexible and
reliable. The ``Request`` provides a dependable way to access information
about the HTTP request. Specifically, the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request::getPathInfo` method returns
a cleaned URI (always returning ``/show`` and never ``/index.php/show``).
So, even if the user goes to ``/index.php/show``, the application is intelligent
enough to route the request through ``show_action()``.

The ``Response`` object gives flexibility when constructing the HTTP response,
allowing HTTP headers and content to be added via an object-oriented interface.
And while the responses in this application are simple, this flexibility
will pay dividends as your application grows.

.. _the-sample-application-in-symfony2:

The Sample Application in Symfony
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The blog has come a *long* way, but it still contains a lot of code for such
a simple application. Along the way, you've made a simple routing
system and a method using ``ob_start()`` and ``ob_get_clean()`` to render
templates. If, for some reason, you needed to continue building this "framework"
from scratch, you could at least use Symfony's standalone
:doc:`Routing </components/routing>` and
:doc:`Templating </components/templating>` components, which already
solve these problems.

Instead of re-solving common problems, you can let Symfony take care of
them for you. Here's the same sample application, now built in Symfony::

    // src/AppBundle/Controller/BlogController.php
    namespace AppBundle\Controller;

    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
    use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;

    class BlogController extends Controller
    {
        public function listAction(EntityManagerInterface $em)
        {
            $posts = $em
                ->createQuery('SELECT p FROM AppBundle:Post p')
                ->execute();

            return $this->render('Blog/list.html.php', array('posts' => $posts));
        }

        public function showAction(EntityManagerInterface $em)
        {
            $post = $em
                ->getRepository('AppBundle:Post')
                ->find($id);

            if (!$post) {
                // cause the 404 page not found to be displayed
                throw $this->createNotFoundException();
            }

            return $this->render('Blog/show.html.php', array('post' => $post));
        }
    }

Notice, both controller functions now live inside a "controller class". This is a
nice way to group related pages. The controller functions are also sometimes called
*actions*.

The two controllers (or actions) are still lightweight. Each uses the
:doc:`Doctrine ORM library </doctrine>` to retrieve objects from the
database and the Templating component to render a template and return a
``Response`` object. The list ``list.php`` template is now quite a bit simpler:

.. code-block:: html+php

    <!-- app/Resources/views/Blog/list.html.php -->
    <?php $view->extend('layout.html.php') ?>

    <?php $view['slots']->set('title', 'List of Posts') ?>

    <h1>List of Posts</h1>
    <ul>
        <?php foreach ($posts as $post): ?>
        <li>
            <a href="<?php echo $view['router']->path(
                'blog_show',
                array('id' => $post->getId())
            ) ?>">
                <?= $post->getTitle() ?>
            </a>
        </li>
        <?php endforeach ?>
    </ul>

The ``layout.php`` file is nearly identical:

.. code-block:: html+php

    <!-- app/Resources/views/layout.html.php -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title><?= $view['slots']->output(
                'title',
                'Default title'
            ) ?></title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <?= $view['slots']->output('_content') ?>
        </body>
    </html>

.. note::

    The show ``show.php`` template is left as an exercise: updating it should be
    really similar to updating the ``list.php`` template.

When Symfony's engine (called the Kernel) boots up, it needs a map so
that it knows which controllers to execute based on the request information.
A routing configuration map - ``app/config/routing.yml`` - provides this information
in a readable format:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml
    blog_list:
        path:     /blog
        defaults: { _controller: AppBundle:Blog:list }

    blog_show:
        path:     /blog/show/{id}
        defaults: { _controller: AppBundle:Blog:show }

Now that Symfony is handling all the mundane tasks, the front controller
``web/app.php`` is dead simple. And since it does so little, you'll never
have to touch it::

    // web/app.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/../app/bootstrap.php';
    require_once __DIR__.'/../app/AppKernel.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    $kernel = new AppKernel('prod', false);
    $kernel->handle(Request::createFromGlobals())->send();

The front controller's only job is to initialize Symfony's engine (called the
Kernel) and pass it a ``Request`` object to handle. The Symfony core
asks the router to inspect the request. The router matches the incoming URL
to a specific route and returns information about the route, including the
controller that should be executed. The correct controller from the matched
route is executed and your code inside the controller creates and returns the
appropriate ``Response`` object. The HTTP headers and content of the ``Response``
object are sent back to the client.

It's a beautiful thing.

Better Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you choose to use it, Symfony comes standard with a templating engine
called `Twig`_ that makes templates faster to write and easier to read.
It means that the sample application could contain even less code! Take,
for example, rewriting ``list.html.php`` template in Twig would look like
this:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    {# app/Resources/views/blog/list.html.twig #}
    {% extends "layout.html.twig" %}

    {% block title %}List of Posts{% endblock %}

    {% block body %}
        <h1>List of Posts</h1>
        <ul>
            {% for post in posts %}
            <li>
                <a href="{{ path('blog_show', {'id': post.id}) }}">
                    {{ post.title }}
                </a>
            </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endblock %}

And rewriting ``layout.html.php`` template in Twig would look like this:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    {# app/Resources/views/layout.html.twig #}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>{% block title %}Default title{% endblock %}</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            {% block body %}{% endblock %}
        </body>
    </html>

Twig is well-supported in Symfony. And while PHP templates will always
be supported in Symfony, the many advantages of Twig will continue to
be discussed. For more information, see the :doc:`templating article </templating>`.

Where Symfony Delivers
----------------------

In the rest of documentation articles, you'll learn more about how each piece of
Symfony works and how you can organize your project. For now, celebrate at how
migrating the blog from flat PHP to Symfony has improved life:

* Your application now has **clear and consistently organized code** (though
  Symfony doesn't force you into this). This promotes **reusability** and
  allows for new developers to be productive in your project more quickly;

* 100% of the code you write is for *your* application. You **don't need
  to develop or maintain low-level utilities** such as autoloading,
  :doc:`routing </routing>`, or rendering :doc:`controllers </controller>`;

* Symfony gives you **access to open source tools** such as `Doctrine`_ and the
  :doc:`Templating </components/templating>`,
  :doc:`Security </components/security>`,
  :doc:`Form </components/form>`, `Validator`_ and
  :doc:`Translation </components/translation>` components (to name
  a few);

* The application now enjoys **fully-flexible URLs** thanks to the Routing
  component;

* Symfony's HTTP-centric architecture gives you access to powerful tools
  such as **HTTP caching** powered by **Symfony's internal HTTP cache** or
  more powerful tools such as `Varnish`_. This is covered in another article
  all about :doc:`caching </http_cache>`.

And perhaps best of all, by using Symfony, you now have access to a whole
set of **high-quality open source tools developed by the Symfony community**!
A good selection of `Symfony community tools`_ can be found on GitHub.
