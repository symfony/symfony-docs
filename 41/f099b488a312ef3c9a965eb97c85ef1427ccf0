That's a great idea! Both methods do the same thing, but this is indeed more expressive to me.

Further up, we also use `getObjectManager()`. Could you change that `getEntityManager()`?

@weaverryan changes done, I also edited the one inside the function named `index()`
I think these changes must be done for all symfony versions not only `symfony:3.3`
