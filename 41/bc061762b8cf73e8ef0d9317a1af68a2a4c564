@fabpot Can we then also remove the ``install.sh`` script and modify the ``.travis.yml`` file accordingly? Or are those still needed for the new process?

@xabbuh Correct, I was not aware of these files. Fixed now.

@fabpot And one other thing: How do we handle ``doc`` directives referencing documents from the ``bundles`` directory (actually, that's why the Travis build fails)? I guess we have to link with absolute URLs then? This must be taken into account once we know where these docs can be viewed.

@xabbuh @fabpot Yes, we will need to turn this into absolute links, which I think is fine.

Fabien, if you agree, you can do it or one of us can fork you and change the references.

Awesome! I can't wait for this to be merged.

The step "(Optionally) Install the bundle docs and CMF docs: bash install.sh;" should also be removed from http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/documentation/format.html#testing-documentation

@WouterJ done

@fabpot I created a PR which removes even more references to third party docs: https://github.com/fabpot/symfony-docs/pull/1

And do these entries in the redirection map still work?
