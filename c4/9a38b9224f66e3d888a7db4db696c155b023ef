Hi 👋 and thanks for your PR.
The only thing which is missing from my side is a versionadded directive.

Thank you for your review, @OskarStark. I've added that directive, but I'm a bit unsure about the wording. Should I somehow mention the old behavior as well or do we expect users to look this up in the older branch of the documentation should they need it?

We could, but to me it’s ok to just mention the “as is”/“current recommendation” 👍🏻🤞🏻

Thanks
