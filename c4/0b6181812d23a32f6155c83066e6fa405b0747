@xabbuh I think the standard is (or should be) annotation before yaml (the validation chapter is like that... but I think I may have just merged a PR that caused this recently). What do do you think?

You're right, Ryan. We switched the order some time this week and I didn't update here. Will do this when I'm back at my desk. Thanks for noticing.

ping @xabbuh  (no rush, just going through the long PR list)

I changed the order of all validation related configuration blocks to respect the new order.
