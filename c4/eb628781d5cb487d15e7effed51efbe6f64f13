Oops, the target branch should be `2.5` not `master`.

@Baptouuuu These are really nice catches! :+1: And don't worry about the target branch. @weaverryan can easily apply the changes to the right branch.

Great fixes!

However, almost all of the fixes in this PR should be merged in the 2.3 branch, except from the change in ``components/dependency_injection/advanced``. Can you please remove that change from this PR and create a new PR based on the 2.5 branch for that change? Thank you!

@WouterJ done.

Hey @Baptouuuu!

I need to merge this into the 2.3 branch, but it's not merging cleanly. If you can rebase this against the 2.3 branch and re-push (not need to open a new PR), then I can merge it in. Assuming `origin` is the `Baptouuuu/symfony` repo and `upstream` is what you called `symfony/symfony`, it should be something like:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout typos
git rebase --onto upstream/2.3 upstream/master
git push origin typos --force
```

Thanks!
