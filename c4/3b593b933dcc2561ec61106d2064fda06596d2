My idea is to document all the rules tagged as **[symfony]** in [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/7ef7ea94ccb0d528daa2f428226958e00926b928/README.rst#usage) within separated PRs and later add a note about the possibility of running the tool with ```--dry-run``` option in order to check if all standards are respected.
What do you think?
