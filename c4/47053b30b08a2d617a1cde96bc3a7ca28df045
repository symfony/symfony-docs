:+1: the new version of Sphinx has been released and the server should be ready (if not, I'll take care of it). Thanks for this improvement. Using anything different thatn `twig` felt unnatural to me.

Please retrigger the Travis and platform.sh builds now that the extension is updated to support Twig, to see whether it works fine
