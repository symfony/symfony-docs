The Security Component
======================

    The Security component provides a complete security system for your web
    application. It ships with facilities for authenticating using HTTP basic
    or digest authentication, interactive form login or X.509 certificate
    login, but also allows you to implement your own authentication strategies.
    Furthermore, the component provides ways to authorize authenticated users
    based on their roles, and it contains an advanced ACL system.

Installation
------------

You can install the component in 2 different ways:

* :doc:`Install it via Composer </components/using_components>` (``symfony/security`` on Packagist_);
