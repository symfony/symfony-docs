Container Building Workflow
===========================

In the preceding pages of this section, there has been little to say about
where the various files and classes should be located. This is because this
depends on the application, library or framework in which you want to use
the container. Looking at how the container is configured and built in the
Symfony full stack framework will help you see how this all fits together,
whether you are using the full stack framework or looking to use the service
container in another application.

The full stack framework uses the HttpKernel component to manage the loading
of the service container configuration from the application and bundles and
also handles the compilation and caching. Even if you are not using HttpKernel,
it should give you an idea of one way of organizing configuration in a modular
application.

Working with a Cached Container
-------------------------------

Before building it, the kernel checks to see if a cached version of the container
exists. The HttpKernel has a debug setting and if this is false, the
cached version is used if it exists. If debug is true then the kernel
:doc:`checks to see if configuration is fresh </components/config/caching>`
and if it is, the cached version of the container is used. If not then the container
is built from the application-level configuration and the bundles's extension
configuration.

Read :ref:`Dumping the Configuration for Performance <components-dependency-injection-dumping>`
for more details.

Application-level Configuration
-------------------------------

Application level config is loaded from the ``app/config`` directory. Multiple
files are loaded which are then merged when the extensions are processed. This
allows for different configuration for different environments e.g. dev, prod.

These files contain parameters and services that are loaded directly into
the container as per :ref:`Setting Up the Container with Configuration Files <components-dependency-injection-loading-config>`.
They also contain configuration that is processed by extensions as per
:ref:`Managing Configuration with Extensions <components-dependency-injection-extension>`.
These are considered to be bundle configuration since each bundle contains
an Extension class.

Bundle-level Configuration with Extensions
------------------------------------------

By convention, each bundle contains an Extension class which is in the bundle's
``DependencyInjection`` directory. These are registered with the ``ContainerBuilder``
when the kernel is booted. When the ``ContainerBuilder`` is :doc:`compiled </components/dependency_injection/compilation>`,
the application-level configuration relevant to the bundle's extension is
passed to the Extension which also usually loads its own config file(s), typically from the bundle's
``Resources/config`` directory. The application-level config is usually processed
with a :doc:`Configuration object </components/config/definition>` also stored
in the bundle's ``DependencyInjection`` directory.

Compiler Passes to Allow Interaction between Bundles
----------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Compiler passes <components-dependency-injection-compiler-passes>` are
used to allow interaction between different bundles as they cannot affect
each other's configuration in the extension classes. One of the main uses is
to process tagged services, allowing bundles to register services to be picked
up by other bundles, such as Monolog loggers, Twig extensions and Data Collectors
for the Web Profiler. Compiler passes are usually placed in the bundle's
``DependencyInjection/Compiler`` directory.

Compilation and Caching
-----------------------

After the compilation process has loaded the services from the configuration,
extensions and the compiler passes, it is dumped so that the cache can be used
next time. The dumped version is then used during subsequent requests as it
is more efficient.
