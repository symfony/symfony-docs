Advanced Container Configuration
================================

Marking Services as public / private
------------------------------------

When defining services, you'll usually want to be able to access these definitions
within your application code. These services are called ``public``. For example,
the ``doctrine`` service registered with the container when using the DoctrineBundle
is a public service as you can access it via::

   $doctrine = $container->get('doctrine');

However, there are use-cases when you don't want a service to be public. This
is common when a service is only defined because it could be used as an
argument for another service.

.. note::

    If you use a private service as an argument to more than one other service,
    this will result in two different instances being used as the instantiation
    of the private service is done inline (e.g. ``new PrivateFooBar()``).

Simply said: A service will be private when you do not want to access it
directly from your code.

Here is an example:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        services:
           foo:
             class: Example\Foo
             public: false

    .. code-block:: xml

        <service id="foo" class="Example\Foo" public="false" />

    .. code-block:: php

        $definition = new Definition('Example\Foo');
        $definition->setPublic(false);
        $container->setDefinition('foo', $definition);

Now that the service is private, you *cannot* call::

    $container->get('foo');

However, if a service has been marked as private, you can still alias it (see
below) to access this service (via the alias).

.. note::

   Services are by default public.

Aliasing
--------

You may sometimes want to use shortcuts to access some services. You can
do so by aliasing them and, furthermore, you can even alias non-public
services.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        services:
           foo:
             class: Example\Foo
           bar:
             alias: foo

    .. code-block:: xml

        <service id="foo" class="Example\Foo"/>

        <service id="bar" alias="foo" />

    .. code-block:: php

        $definition = new Definition('Example\Foo');
        $container->setDefinition('foo', $definition);

        $containerBuilder->setAlias('bar', 'foo');

This means that when using the container directly, you can access the ``foo``
service by asking for the ``bar`` service like this::

    $container->get('bar'); // Would return the foo service

Requiring files
---------------

There might be use cases when you need to include another file just before
the service itself gets loaded. To do so, you can use the ``file`` directive.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        services:
           foo:
             class: Example\Foo\Bar
             file: %kernel.root_dir%/src/path/to/file/foo.php

    .. code-block:: xml

        <service id="foo" class="Example\Foo\Bar">
            <file>%kernel.root_dir%/src/path/to/file/foo.php</file>
        </service>

    .. code-block:: php

        $definition = new Definition('Example\Foo\Bar');
        $definition->setFile('%kernel.root_dir%/src/path/to/file/foo.php');
        $container->setDefinition('foo', $definition);

Notice that symfony will internally call the PHP function require_once
which means that your file will be included only once per request.
