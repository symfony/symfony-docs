The ClassLoader Component
=========================

    The ClassLoader component provides tools to autoload your classes and
    cache their locations for performance.

Usage
-----

Whenever you reference a class that has not been required or included yet,
PHP uses the `autoloading mechanism`_ to delegate the loading of a file defining
the class. Symfony provides three autoloaders, which are able to load your classes:

* :doc:`/components/class_loader/class_loader`: loads classes that follow
  the `PSR-0` class naming standard;

* :doc:`/components/class_loader/psr4_class_loader`: loads classes that follow
  the `PSR-4` class naming standard;

* :doc:`/components/class_loader/map_class_loader`: loads classes using
  a static map from class name to file path.

Additionally, the Symfony ClassLoader component ships with a wrapper class
which makes it possible
:doc:`to cache the results of a class loader </components/class_loader/cache_class_loader>`.

When using the :doc:`Debug component </components/debug/introduction>`, you
can also use a special :doc:`DebugClassLoader </components/debug/class_loader>`
that eases debugging by throwing more helpful exceptions when a class could
not be found by a class loader.

Installation
------------

You can install the component in 2 different ways:

* :doc:`Install it via Composer </components/using_components>` (``symfony/class-loader``
  on `Packagist`_);
* Use the official Git repository (https://github.com/symfony/ClassLoader).
