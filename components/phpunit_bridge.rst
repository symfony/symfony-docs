The PHPUnit Bridge
==================

    The PHPUnit Bridge provides utilities to report legacy tests and usage of
    deprecated code.

It comes with the following features:

* Forces the tests to use a consistent locale (``C``);

* Auto-register ``class_exists`` to load Doctrine annotations (when used);

* It displays the whole list of deprecated features used in the application;

* Displays the stack trace of a deprecation on-demand;

.. versionadded:: 2.7
    The PHPUnit Bridge was introduced in Symfony 2.7. It is however possible to
    install the bridge in any Symfony application (even 2.3).

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/phpunit-bridge

Alternatively, you can clone the `<https://github.com/symfony/phpunit-bridge>`_ repository.

.. include:: /components/require_autoload.rst.inc

Usage
-----

Once the component is installed, a ``simple-phpunit`` script is created in the
``vendor/`` directory to run tests. This script wraps the original PHPUnit binary
to provide more features:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ cd my-project/
    $ ./vendor/bin/simple-phpunit

After running your PHPUnit tests, you will get a report similar to this one:

.. image:: /_images/components/phpunit_bridge/report.png

The summary includes:

**Unsilenced**
    Reports deprecation notices that were triggered without the recommended
    `@-silencing operator`_.

**Legacy**
    Deprecation notices denote tests that explicitly test some legacy features.

**Remaining/Other**
    Deprecation notices are all other (non-legacy) notices, grouped by message,
    test class and method.

.. note::

    If you don't want to use the ``simple-phpunit`` script, register the following
    `PHPUnit event listener`_ in your PHPUnit configuration file to get the same
    report about deprecations (which is created by a `PHP error handler`_
    called :class:`Symfony\\Bridge\\PhpUnit\\DeprecationErrorHandler`):

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- phpunit.xml.dist -->
        <!-- ... -->
        <listeners>
            <listener class="Symfony\Bridge\PhpUnit\SymfonyTestsListener" />
        </listeners>

Trigger Deprecation Notices
---------------------------

Deprecation notices can be triggered by using::

    @trigger_error('Your deprecation message', E_USER_DEPRECATED);

Without the `@-silencing operator`_, users would need to opt-out from deprecation
notices. Silencing by default swaps this behavior and allows users to opt-in
when they are ready to cope with them (by adding a custom error handler like the
one provided by this bridge). When not silenced, deprecation notices will appear
in the **Unsilenced** section of the deprecation report.

Mark Tests as Legacy
--------------------

There are three ways to mark a test as legacy:

* (**Recommended**) Add the ``@group legacy`` annotation to its class or method;

* Make its class name start with the ``Legacy`` prefix;

* Make its method name start with ``testLegacy*()`` instead of ``test*()``.

.. note::

    If your data provider calls code that would usually trigger a deprecation,
    you can prefix its name with ``provideLegacy`` or ``getLegacy`` to silent
    these deprecations. If your data provider does not execute deprecated
    code, it is not required to choose a special naming just because the
    test being fed by the data provider is marked as legacy.

    Also be aware that choosing one of the two legacy prefixes will not mark
    tests as legacy that make use of this data provider. You still have to
    mark them as legacy tests explicitly.

Configuration
-------------

In case you need to inspect the stack trace of a particular deprecation
triggered by your unit tests, you can set the ``SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER``
`environment variable`_ to a regular expression that matches this deprecation's
message, enclosed with ``/``. For example, with:

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- http://phpunit.de/manual/4.1/en/appendixes.configuration.html -->
    <phpunit xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://schema.phpunit.de/4.1/phpunit.xsd"
    >

        <!-- ... -->

        <php>
            <server name="KERNEL_DIR" value="app/" />
            <env name="SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER" value="/foobar/" />
        </php>
    </phpunit>

PHPUnit_ will stop your test suite once a deprecation notice is triggered whose
message contains the ``"foobar"`` string.

Making Tests Fail
-----------------

By default, any non-legacy-tagged or any non-`@-silenced`_ deprecation notices will
make tests fail. Alternatively, setting ``SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER`` to an
arbitrary value (ex: ``320``) will make the tests fails only if a higher number
of deprecation notices is reached (``0`` is the default value). You can also set
the value ``"weak"`` which will make the bridge ignore any deprecation notices.
This is useful to projects that must use deprecated interfaces for backward
compatibility reasons.
