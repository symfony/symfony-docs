The Process Component
=====================

    The Process component executes commands in sub-processes.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/process

Alternatively, you can clone the `<https://github.com/symfony/process>`_ repository.

.. include:: /components/require_autoload.rst.inc

Usage
-----

The :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process` class allows you to execute
a command in a sub-process::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;
    use Symfony\Component\Process\Exception\ProcessFailedException;

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->run();

    // executes after the command finishes
    if (!$process->isSuccessful()) {
        throw new ProcessFailedException($process);
    }

    echo $process->getOutput();

The component takes care of the subtle differences between the different platforms
when executing the command.

The ``getOutput()`` method always returns the whole content of the standard
output of the command and ``getErrorOutput()`` the content of the error
output. Alternatively, the :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::getIncrementalOutput`
and :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::getIncrementalErrorOutput`
methods return the new output since the last call.

The :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::clearOutput` method clears
the contents of the output and
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::clearErrorOutput` clears
the contents of the error output.

You can also use the :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process` class with the
foreach construct to get the output while it is generated. By default, the loop waits
for new output before going to the next iteration::

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->start();

    foreach ($process as $type => $data) {
        if ($process::OUT === $type) {
            echo "\nRead from stdout: ".$data;
        } else { // $process::ERR === $type
            echo "\nRead from stderr: ".$data;
        }
    }

.. tip::

    The Process component internally uses a PHP iterator to get the output while
    it is generated. That iterator is exposed via the ``getIterator()`` method
    to allow customizing its behavior::

        $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
        $process->start();
        $iterator = $process->getIterator($process::ITER_SKIP_ERR | $process::ITER_KEEP_OUTPUT);
        foreach ($iterator as $data) {
            echo $data."\n";
        }

    .. versionadded:: 3.2
        The ``getIterator()`` method was introduced in Symfony 3.2.

The ``mustRun()`` method is identical to ``run()``, except that it will throw
a :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Exception\\ProcessFailedException`
if the process couldn't be executed successfully (i.e. the process exited
with a non-zero code)::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Exception\ProcessFailedException;
    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');

    try {
        $process->mustRun();

        echo $process->getOutput();
    } catch (ProcessFailedException $exception) {
        echo $exception->getMessage();
    }

Getting real-time Process Output
--------------------------------

When executing a long running command (like rsync-ing files to a remote
server), you can give feedback to the end user in real-time by passing an
anonymous function to the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::run` method::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->run(function ($type, $buffer) {
        if (Process::ERR === $type) {
            echo 'ERR > '.$buffer;
        } else {
            echo 'OUT > '.$buffer;
        }
    });

Running Processes Asynchronously
--------------------------------

You can also start the subprocess and then let it run asynchronously, retrieving
output and the status in your main process whenever you need it. Use the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::start` method to start an asynchronous
process, the :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::isRunning` method
to check if the process is done and the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::getOutput` method to get the output::

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->start();

    while ($process->isRunning()) {
        // waiting for process to finish
    }

    echo $process->getOutput();

You can also wait for a process to end if you started it asynchronously and
are done doing other stuff::

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->start();

    // ... do other things

    $process->wait();

    // ... do things after the process has finished

.. note::

    The :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::wait` method is blocking,
    which means that your code will halt at this line until the external
    process is completed.

.. note::

    If a ``Response`` is sent **before** a child process had a chance to complete,
    the server process will be killed (depending on your OS). It means that
    your task will be stopped right away. Running an asynchronous process
    is not the same as running a process that survives its parent process.

    If you want your process to survive the request/response cycle, you can
    take advantage of the ``kernel.terminate`` event, and run your command
    **synchronously** inside this event. Be aware that ``kernel.terminate``
    is called only if you use PHP-FPM.

.. caution::

    Beware also that if you do that, the said PHP-FPM process will not be
    available to serve any new request until the subprocess is finished. This
    means you can quickly block your FPM pool if you're not careful enough.
    That is why it's generally way better not to do any fancy things even
    after the request is sent, but to use a job queue instead.

:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::wait` takes one optional argument:
a callback that is called repeatedly whilst the process is still running, passing
in the output and its type::

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->start();

    $process->wait(function ($type, $buffer) {
        if (Process::ERR === $type) {
            echo 'ERR > '.$buffer;
        } else {
            echo 'OUT > '.$buffer;
        }
    });

Streaming to the Standard Input of a Process
--------------------------------------------

Before a process is started, you can specify its standard input using either the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::setInput` method or the 4th argument
of the constructor. The provided input can be a string, a stream resource or a
Traversable object::

    $process = new Process('cat');
    $process->setInput('foobar');
    $process->run();

When this input is fully written to the subprocess standard input, the corresponding
pipe is closed.

In order to write to a subprocess standard input while it is running, the component
provides the :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\InputStream` class::

    $input = new InputStream();
    $input->write('foo');

    $process = new Process('cat');
    $process->setInput($input);
    $process->start();

    // ... read process output or do other things

    $input->write('bar');
    $input->close();

    $process->wait();

    // will echo: foobar
    echo $process->getOutput();

The :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\InputStream::write` method accepts scalars,
stream resources or Traversable objects as argument. As shown in the above example,
you need to explicitly call the :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\InputStream::close`
method when you are done writing to the standard input of the subprocess.

Using PHP Streams as the Standard Input of a Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input of a process can also be defined using `PHP streams`_::

    $stream = fopen('php://temporary', 'w+');

    $process = new Process('cat');
    $process->setInput($stream);
    $process->start();

    fwrite($stream, 'foo');

    // ... read process output or do other things

    fwrite($stream, 'bar');
    fclose($stream);

    $process->wait();

    // will echo: 'foobar'
    echo $process->getOutput();

Stopping a Process
------------------

Any asynchronous process can be stopped at any time with the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::stop` method. This method takes
two arguments: a timeout and a signal. Once the timeout is reached, the signal
is sent to the running process. The default signal sent to a process is ``SIGKILL``.
Please read the :ref:`signal documentation below<reference-process-signal>`
to find out more about signal handling in the Process component::

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->start();

    // ... do other things

    $process->stop(3, SIGINT);

Executing PHP Code in Isolation
-------------------------------

If you want to execute some PHP code in isolation, use the ``PhpProcess``
instead::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\PhpProcess;

    $process = new PhpProcess(<<<EOF
        <?php echo 'Hello World'; ?>
    EOF
    );
    $process->run();

To make your code work better on all platforms, you might want to use the
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\ProcessBuilder` class instead::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\ProcessBuilder;

    $processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder(array('ls', '-lsa'));
    $processBuilder->getProcess()->run();

In case you are building a binary driver, you can use the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\ProcessBuilder::setPrefix` method to prefix all
the generated process commands.

The following example will generate two process commands for a tar binary
adapter::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\ProcessBuilder;

    $processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder();
    $processBuilder->setPrefix('/usr/bin/tar');

    // '/usr/bin/tar' '--list' '--file=archive.tar.gz'
    echo $processBuilder
        ->setArguments(array('--list', '--file=archive.tar.gz'))
        ->getProcess()
        ->getCommandLine();

    // '/usr/bin/tar' '-xzf' 'archive.tar.gz'
    echo $processBuilder
        ->setArguments(array('-xzf', 'archive.tar.gz'))
        ->getProcess()
        ->getCommandLine();

Process Timeout
---------------

You can limit the amount of time a process takes to complete by setting a
timeout (in seconds)::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->setTimeout(3600);
    $process->run();

If the timeout is reached, a
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Exception\\RuntimeException` is thrown.

For long running commands, it is your responsibility to perform the timeout
check regularly::

    $process->setTimeout(3600);
    $process->start();

    while ($condition) {
        // ...

        // check if the timeout is reached
        $process->checkTimeout();

        usleep(200000);
    }

.. _reference-process-signal:

Process Idle Timeout
--------------------

In contrast to the timeout of the previous paragraph, the idle timeout only
considers the time since the last output was produced by the process::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('something-with-variable-runtime');
    $process->setTimeout(3600);
    $process->setIdleTimeout(60);
    $process->run();

In the case above, a process is considered timed out, when either the total runtime
exceeds 3600 seconds, or the process does not produce any output for 60 seconds.

Process Signals
---------------

When running a program asynchronously, you can send it POSIX signals with the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::signal` method::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('find / -name "rabbit"');
    $process->start();

    // will send a SIGKILL to the process
    $process->signal(SIGKILL);

.. caution::

    Due to some limitations in PHP, if you're using signals with the Process
    component, you may have to prefix your commands with `exec`_. Please read
    `Symfony Issue#5759`_ and `PHP Bug#39992`_ to understand why this is happening.

    POSIX signals are not available on Windows platforms, please refer to the
    `PHP documentation`_ for available signals.

Process Pid
-----------

You can access the `pid`_ of a running process with the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::getPid` method::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('/usr/bin/php worker.php');
    $process->start();

    $pid = $process->getPid();

.. caution::

    Due to some limitations in PHP, if you want to get the pid of a symfony Process,
    you may have to prefix your commands with `exec`_. Please read
    `Symfony Issue#5759`_ to understand why this is happening.

Disabling Output
----------------

As standard output and error output are always fetched from the underlying process,
it might be convenient to disable output in some cases to save memory.
Use :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::disableOutput` and
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::enableOutput` to toggle this feature::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('/usr/bin/php worker.php');
    $process->disableOutput();
    $process->run();

.. caution::

    You cannot enable or disable the output while the process is running.

    If you disable the output, you cannot access ``getOutput()``,
    ``getIncrementalOutput()``, ``getErrorOutput()``, ``getIncrementalErrorOutput()`` or
    ``setIdleTimeout()``.

    However, it is possible to pass a callback to the ``start``, ``run`` or ``mustRun``
    methods to handle process output in a streaming fashion.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
        The ability to pass a callback to these methods when output is disabled
        was added in Symfony 3.1.

Finding the Executable PHP Binary
---------------------------------

This component also provides a utility class called
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\PhpExecutableFinder` which returns the
absolute path of the executable PHP binary available on your server::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\PhpExecutableFinder;

    $phpBinaryFinder = new PhpExecutableFinder();
    $phpBinaryPath = $phpBinaryFinder->find();
    // $phpBinaryPath = '/usr/local/bin/php' (the result will be different on your computer)
