The Process Component
=====================

    The Process Component executes commands in sub-processes.

Installation
------------

You can install the component in 2 different ways:

* Use the official Git repository (https://github.com/symfony/Process);
* :doc:`Install it via Composer </components/using_components>` (``symfony/process`` on `Packagist`_).

Usage
-----

The :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process` class allows you to execute
a command in a sub-process::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->run();

    // executes after the command finishes
    if (!$process->isSuccessful()) {
        throw new \RuntimeException($process->getErrorOutput());
    }

    print $process->getOutput();

The component takes care of the subtle differences between the different platforms
when executing the command.

.. versionadded:: 2.2
    The ``getIncrementalOutput()`` and ``getIncrementalErrorOutput()`` methods were added in Symfony 2.2.

The ``getOutput()`` method always return the whole content of the standard
output of the command and ``getErrorOutput()`` the content of the error
output. Alternatively, the :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::getIncrementalOutput`
and :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::getIncrementalErrorOutput`
methods returns the new outputs since the last call.

Getting real-time Process Output
--------------------------------

When executing a long running command (like rsync-ing files to a remote
server), you can give feedback to the end user in real-time by passing an
anonymous function to the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::run` method::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->run(function ($type, $buffer) {
        if (Process::ERR === $type) {
            echo 'ERR > '.$buffer;
        } else {
            echo 'OUT > '.$buffer;
        }
    });

.. versionadded:: 2.1
    The non-blocking feature was added in 2.1.

Running Processes Asynchronously
--------------------------------

You can also start the subprocess and then let it run asynchronously, retrieving
output and the status in your main process whenever you need it. Use the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::start` method to start an asynchronous
process, the :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::isRunning` method
to check if the process is done and the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::getOutput` method to get the output::

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->start();

    while ($process->isRunning()) {
        // waiting for process to finish
    }

    echo $process->getOutput();

You can also wait for a process to end if you started it asynchronously and
are done doing other stuff::

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->start();

    // ... do other things

    $process->wait(function ($type, $buffer) {
        if (Process::ERR === $type) {
            echo 'ERR > '.$buffer;
        } else {
            echo 'OUT > '.$buffer;
        }
    });

Stopping a Process
------------------

Any asynchronous process can be stopped at any time with the
:method:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process::stop` method. This method takes
a timeout as its argument. Once the timeout is reached, the process is terminated.

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->start();

    // ... do other things

    $process->stop(3);

Executing PHP Code in Isolation
-------------------------------

If you want to execute some PHP code in isolation, use the ``PhpProcess``
instead::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\PhpProcess;

    $process = new PhpProcess(<<<EOF
        <?php echo 'Hello World'; ?>
    EOF
    );
    $process->run();

.. versionadded:: 2.1
    The ``ProcessBuilder`` class was added in Symfony 2.1.

To make your code work better on all platforms, you might want to use the
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Process\\ProcessBuilder` class instead::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\ProcessBuilder;

    $builder = new ProcessBuilder(array('ls', '-lsa'));
    $builder->getProcess()->run();

Process Timeout
---------------

You can limit the amount of time a process takes to complete by setting a
timeout (in seconds)::

    use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

    $process = new Process('ls -lsa');
    $process->setTimeout(3600);
    $process->run();

If the timeout is reached, a
:class:`Symfony\\Process\\Exception\\RuntimeException` is thrown.

For long running commands, it is your responsibility to perform the timeout
check regularly::

    $process->setTimeout(3600);
    $process->start();

    while ($condition) {
        // ...

        // check if the timeout is reached
        $process->checkTimeout();

        usleep(200000);
    }
