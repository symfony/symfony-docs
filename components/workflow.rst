The Workflow Component
======================

    The Workflow component provides tools for managing a workflow or finite
    state machine.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/workflow

.. include:: /components/require_autoload.rst.inc

Creating a Workflow
-------------------

The workflow component gives you an object oriented way to define a process
or a life cycle that your object goes through. Each step or stage in the
process is called a *place*. You do also define *transitions* that describe
the action to get from one place to another.

    :alt: An example state diagram for a workflow, showing transitions and places.

A set of places and transitions creates a **definition**. A workflow needs
a ``Definition`` and a way to write the states to the objects (i.e. an
instance of a :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Workflow\\MarkingStore\\MarkingStoreInterface`).

Consider the following example for a blog post. A post can have one of a number
of predefined statuses (``draft``, ``reviewed``, ``rejected``, ``published``). In a workflow,
these statuses are called **places**. You can define the workflow like this::

    use Symfony\Component\Workflow\DefinitionBuilder;
    use Symfony\Component\Workflow\MarkingStore\MethodMarkingStore;
    use Symfony\Component\Workflow\Transition;
    use Symfony\Component\Workflow\Workflow;

    $definitionBuilder = new DefinitionBuilder();
    $definition = $definitionBuilder->addPlaces(['draft', 'reviewed', 'rejected', 'published'])
        // Transitions are defined with a unique name, an origin place and a destination place
        ->addTransition(new Transition('to_review', 'draft', 'reviewed'))
        ->addTransition(new Transition('publish', 'reviewed', 'published'))
        ->addTransition(new Transition('reject', 'reviewed', 'rejected'))
        ->build()
    ;

    $singleState = true; // true if the subject can be in only one state at a given time
    $property = 'currentState'; // subject property name where the state is stored
    $marking = new MethodMarkingStore($singleState, $property);
    $workflow = new Workflow($definition, $marking);

The ``Workflow`` can now help you to decide what *transitions* (actions) are allowed
on a blog post depending on what *place* (state) it is in. This will keep your domain
logic in one place and not spread all over your application.

Usage
-----

Here's an example of using the workflow defined above::

    // ...
    // Consider that $blogPost is in place "draft" by default
    $blogPost = new BlogPost();

    $workflow->can($blogPost, 'publish'); // False
    $workflow->can($blogPost, 'to_review'); // True

    $workflow->apply($blogPost, 'to_review'); // $blogPost is now in place "reviewed"

    $workflow->can($blogPost, 'publish'); // True
    $workflow->getEnabledTransitions($blogPost); // $blogPost can perform transition "publish" or "reject"

Initialization
--------------

If the property of your object is ``null`` and you want to set it with the
``initial_marking`` from the configuration, you can call the ``getMarking()``
method to initialize the object property::

    // ...
    $blogPost = new BlogPost();

    // initiate workflow
    $workflow->getMarking($blogPost);

Using The Workflow Registry
---------------------------

When you define multiple workflows you may consider using a ``Registry``,
which is an object that stores and provides access to different workflows.
A registry will also help you to decide if a workflow supports the object you
are trying to use it with::

    use Acme\Entity\BlogPost;
    use Acme\Entity\Newsletter;
    use Symfony\Component\Workflow\Registry;
    use Symfony\Component\Workflow\SupportStrategy\InstanceOfSupportStrategy;

    $blogPostWorkflow = ...;
    $newsletterWorkflow = ...;

    $registry = new Registry();
    $registry->addWorkflow($blogPostWorkflow, new InstanceOfSupportStrategy(BlogPost::class));
    $registry->addWorkflow($newsletterWorkflow, new InstanceOfSupportStrategy(Newsletter::class));

You can then use the registry to get the workflow for a specific object::

    $blogPost = new BlogPost();
    $workflow = $registry->get($blogPost);

    // initiate workflow
    $workflow->getMarking($blogPost);

.. caution::

    Beware that injecting the ``Registry`` into your services is **not**
    recommended. Indeed, it prevents some optimization like lazy-loading
    from working and could be a performance hog. Instead, you should always
    inject the workflow you need.
