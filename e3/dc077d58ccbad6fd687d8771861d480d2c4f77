Thanks for the typo fix, that's correct!

However, in reStructured Text (the markup language used), you can't nest inline markup. So your code doesn't work either (see also the [platform.sh build of this PR](http://pr-6913-6qmocelev2lwe.eu.platform.sh/controller.html#the-request-object-as-a-controller-argument)). Can you please update this PR (by adding a new commit to the patch-4 branch) to remove all markup around `Request` (so just making it bold, no literals or API references)? Thanks! (if you don't have the time, just comment and we'll do it during the merge)

status: needs work

Hello, @wouterj! Thanks for the heads-up. I wasn't aware of this limitation and I should have checked the deployment results. It is a good lesson for the future PRs.
I updated the mark-up as you suggested.
Thanks, Denis!

Thanks for your quick reactions! (if you have some time, please remove the single backticks around Request as well)
