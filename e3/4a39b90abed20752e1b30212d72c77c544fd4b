I would just add a small note saying that these BC rules don't apply on classes/methods tagged as ``@internal``

@stof We already have this caution blocks (and a similar one for classes):

>  The exception to this rule are interfaces tagged with ``@internal``. Such interfaces should not be used or implemented.
