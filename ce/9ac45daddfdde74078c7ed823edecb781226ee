Hi Ben ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for this improvement, not sure we need to be reproducable.
Is this image build all the time or is it cached?

@javiereguiluz WDYT?

@localheinz can you please leave your 2 cents here? Thanks!

@OskarStark hey, this is just a personal preference really.
I just pushed a commit removing the custom action.

@OskarStark I don't know much about GitHub actions, so you'll need to make a decision about this: is this something that fixes issues? improves things? Does it complicate anything? Would we lose something? etc. Thanks!
