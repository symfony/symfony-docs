@vertisan good catch! This can be verified in the related Symfony code: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/e479b6902e2f3be2c802f846f220eeb119a82aa0/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/DependencyInjection/Security/Factory/RememberMeFactory.php#L65-L69  Thank you!

By the way, there's no need to create another PR for the 'master' branch. We always "upmerge" pull requests from lower branches up to master.
