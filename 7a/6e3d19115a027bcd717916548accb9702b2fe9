Hehe this is why I suggested yesterday on twitter to add the DoctrineBundle documentation on to the symfony bundle documentation as well. But this will take some time according to @javiereguiluz.

@peterrehm :+1: for adding the XML example (of possible).

@xabbuh Yea, but we don't show the XML version of the full configuration, so there's no spot for it (and I don't really want to start doing the full XML for this).

@weaverryan Yeah, you're right. I didn't spot that we are talking about the full documentation reference.
