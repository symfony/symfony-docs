@javiereguiluz Does that mean it's worthless (or could even hurt us) when using subdirectories inside the `images` directory?

@xabbuh I'm afraid so :(

In this case, I suggest that we do not use subdirectories at all which would allow us to detect conflicts ourselves earlier. What do you think?

I'd recommend to finish this PR first and then we can discuss about the best strategy for the naming of images. Thanks!

Please, let's merge this to fix the image problem. Thanks!
