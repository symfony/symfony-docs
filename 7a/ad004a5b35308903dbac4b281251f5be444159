Nice feature, thanks, can you add a short example on how to get this info/context in the message handler? Thanks ðŸ˜ƒ

Hmm... This is not aimed to be used by the message handler, and I don't have any use-case for this.

The purpose of this feature is to make `UrlGenerator` working out of the box, without providing `asset.request_context` parameters

```
$this->urlGenerator->generate('route', [], UrlGeneratorInterface::ABSOLUTE_URL);
// before: http://localhost/my_route
// after: https://my-real-domain:81/my_route

```

Ah so you don't care about it directly, and just use the urGenerator which takes the provided request context into account?

yes, exactly. Main use case: Generating an email with link to your application, and the template is rendered by the consumer (the `message` contains only the template + few parameters)
