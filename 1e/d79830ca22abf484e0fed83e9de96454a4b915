A quick win and a nice improvement! @AAstakhov thanks for helping us improve the Symfony docs.

Thanks for the heads up @AAstakhov. However, I'd say let's link to the rendered docs on http://atlantic18.github.io/DoctrineExtensions/doc/translatable.html.

I don't think promote the old (and buggy) Gedmo implementation is a good idea, KNP is simpler and better.

@webda2l Would you like to open a new issue for that? We can, of course, discuss to promote another library but we should discuss that apart from this PR which just fixes the link.

This is a just that this PR "Updated link" could become "Remove link", but more people should give their opinion.
But let's merge this PR for now if you want, no problem.
