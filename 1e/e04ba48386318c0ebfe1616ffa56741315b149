is it customary to link ```logrotate``` to some linux official link?

i think this topic is very important. shouldn't we provide an example logrotate configuration?

@timglabisch I don't think documenting logrotate is in the scope of the symfony doc. Linking to the logrotate doc seems a better idea.

Anybody knows which is the official web site of `logrotate`?

Looking at what is provided in the `logrotate` manpage, there seems to be nothing else than https://fedorahosted.org/logrotate/.

@xabbuh thanks for the reference. I've just linked the `logrotate` command to that URL.

:+1: Looks good to me. By the way, how is this handled on Windows?
