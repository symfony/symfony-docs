@carlos-granados Thank you for your good job. I just left you some last minor comment and restarted the Travis build (it's green now :)). We also have at least one other routing config example on that page (when talking about hinclude.js). Would you like to update that as well?

Ok, will look at it tomorrow

@xabbuh I added the missing namespace statements. In the case of about hinclude.js examples, they are not routing examples, they are config examples, so there is no annotations code that can be added
