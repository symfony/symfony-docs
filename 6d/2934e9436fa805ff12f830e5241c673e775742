Oh and one more thing: We provide "backwards compatiblity" for section titles. That means that if you change a title "Start working on your patch" to "Start working on your PR", we have to add another anchor for the old title (`_start-working-on-your-patch:` in this example) above it

@wouterj did I handle the BC for the section titles correctly now?

Yes. Except that I gave you wrong instructions (turns out the syntax is `.. _old-title:`, but I'm happy to fix that while merging the PR

Thanks Lukas! I've merged this into 3.4 and will merge it up from there. Also, while merging I solved some more wrong references, hope everything passes now.
