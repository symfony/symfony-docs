Hi @weaverryan. Yes, it's a required parameter from version 7.0.0 of PHP. @see http://php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php

It’s not required, right? Just available?

Sorry, you are right. It's symply recommended for security reasons.

Can you explain what it does? Why is it useful here? And what does it protect from? Sorry, I’m just not familiar - and the php.net description didn’t help much :)

@weaverryan it disallows initiating classes from the serialized string. For instance, if a hacker is able to change the serialized string in the session, they are able to set the username for instance to some object. This can pose security issues.

Setting it to false gives a php error in this case.
