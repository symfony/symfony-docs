Would these changes apply to 4.4 branch too?

Hmm it could, but they are cosmetic fix, and the https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/14365/files#diff-1dc6462c0bc00fcdc7cba99d2f13e400L343 has been introduced in 5.1.
That would requires to create 2 PR.

TO you want me to rebase on 5.1.?

No, don't worry about that. 5.1 is fine then (we'll rebase while merging). Thanks!
