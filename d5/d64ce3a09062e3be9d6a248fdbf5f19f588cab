PATCH also has a special property in that if any fields are missing from the submit, those won't be removed: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/HttpFoundation/HttpFoundationRequestHandler.php#L80

That uses the 2nd argument of the `submit` method, which is also not something we mention in the docs, but which is probably out of the scope here.

@bicpi Can you add a quick note about the PATCH behavior? Then, if you're ready, I'd like to merge this!

Cheers!

@weaverryan Added a note about the PATCH method, hope that it's well drafted.
