I think it was better to link to the [cookbook article](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/host_restriction.html).

Actually I didn't found this cookbook entry, when I search for the solution, but at least on the config page, this option should be shown.
You mean, extend the security page line and add also the link?

In the book article I'd add a section mentioning that you can restrict a firewall to a host and link this to the cookbook article (or even better add it to the existing list of related cookbook articles).

In the config reference you can keep it as you did it but please add a ``versionadded`` directive.

I updated it with your suggestions

I copied that one out from the referenced cookbook entry, so I changed the word to "introduced" there also.

:+1: We just decided quite recently to use this wording. So, thank you very much to adapt this in the cookbook entry!

Then I will look out for this in the future.
