So I removed references to the array defaults. This should be added back in another PR if @xabbuh PR is getting merged.

I've also changed the `name` parameter to `title`. It makes more sense as the example is talking about a blog.

Should be good to merge now.

Sorry I was on holiday, I couldn't work on this. So basically I should move all of this in a new cookbook entry, right? I'll try to do it by the end of the week.

No worries :). Yes, a new cookbook entry then we'll have another look.

Thanks!

I've added the new cookbook entry. If it's sounds OK, I'll squash my commits. Otherwise let me know what to change.

@iamdto I added some minor notes, but it looks great to me after those. Thanks for the hard work!

I've updated my commit, let me know if I need to change something.

@iamdto I've found one very minor thing, apart from that it's finished imo

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iamdto at 2014-09-22T08:54:26Z

Should be good now.

Updated.

Sidenote about GitHub: are you notified when commits are added or updated?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-09-22T17:04:42Z

@iamdto No, you would have to write a comment to notify users who are subscribed to it.

Anyway, I think it's ready to be merged now. Nice job! :+1:
