This caveat might get lost in the large code example. My suggestion is to use a tip block under the code block that highlights this caveat:

```
.. tip::

    When PHP-FPM is hosted on a different machine from nginx $realpath_root
    may not resolve as expected! In this case try using $document_root instead.
```
