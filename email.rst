How to Send an Email
====================

Sending emails is a classic task for any web application and one that has
special complications and potential pitfalls. Instead of recreating the wheel,
one solution to send emails is to use the SwiftmailerBundle, which leverages
the power of the `Swift Mailer`_ library. This bundle comes with the Symfony
Standard Edition.

.. _swift-mailer-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

To use Swift Mailer, you'll need to configure it for your mail server.

.. tip::

    Instead of setting up/using your own mail server, you may want to use
    a hosted mail provider such as `Mandrill`_, `SendGrid`_, `Amazon SES`_
    or others. These give you an SMTP server, username and password (sometimes
    called keys) that can be used with the Swift Mailer configuration.

In a standard Symfony installation, some ``swiftmailer`` configuration is
already included:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        swiftmailer:
            transport: '%mailer_transport%'
            host:      '%mailer_host%'
            username:  '%mailer_user%'
            password:  '%mailer_password%'

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:swiftmailer="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/swiftmailer"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/swiftmailer http://symfony.com/schema/dic/swiftmailer/swiftmailer-1.0.xsd">

            <swiftmailer:config
                transport="%mailer_transport%"
                host="%mailer_host%"
                username="%mailer_user%"
                password="%mailer_password%"
            />
        </container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('swiftmailer', array(
            'transport'  => "%mailer_transport%",
            'host'       => "%mailer_host%",
            'username'   => "%mailer_user%",
            'password'   => "%mailer_password%",
        ));

These values (e.g. ``%mailer_transport%``), are reading from the parameters
that are set in the :ref:`parameters.yml <config-parameters.yml>` file. You
can modify the values in that file, or set the values directly here.

The following configuration attributes are available:

* ``transport`` (``smtp``, ``mail``, ``sendmail``, or ``gmail``)
* ``username``
* ``password``
* ``host``
* ``port``
* ``encryption`` (``tls``, or ``ssl``)
* ``auth_mode`` (``plain``, ``login``, or ``cram-md5``)
* ``spool``

  * ``type`` (how to queue the messages, ``file`` or ``memory`` are supported by default, see :doc:`/email/spool`; you can also use ``automailer`` spool type which stores messages in a DB queue, see https://github.com/radutopala/TSSAutomailerBundle)
  * ``path`` (where to store the messages)
* ``delivery_addresses`` (an array of email addresses where to send ALL emails)
* ``disable_delivery`` (set to true to disable delivery completely)

.. caution::

    Starting from SwiftMailer 5.4.5, the ``mail`` transport is deprecated
    and will be removed in version 6. Consider using another transport like
    ``smtp``, ``sendmail`` or ``gmail``.

Sending Emails
--------------

The Swift Mailer library works by creating, configuring and then sending
``Swift_Message`` objects. The "mailer" is responsible for the actual delivery
of the message and is accessible via the ``mailer`` service. Overall, sending
an email is pretty straightforward::

    public function indexAction($name, \Swift_Mailer $mailer)
    {
        $message = (new \Swift_Message('Hello Email'))
            ->setFrom('send@example.com')
            ->setTo('recipient@example.com')
            ->setBody(
                $this->renderView(
                    // app/Resources/views/Emails/registration.html.twig
                    'Emails/registration.html.twig',
                    array('name' => $name)
                ),
                'text/html'
            )
            /*
             * If you also want to include a plaintext version of the message
            ->addPart(
                $this->renderView(
                    'Emails/registration.txt.twig',
                    array('name' => $name)
                ),
                'text/plain'
            )
            */
        ;

        $mailer->send($message);

        // or, you can also fetch the mailer service this way
        // $this->get('mailer')->send($message);

        return $this->render(...);
    }

To keep things decoupled, the email body has been stored in a template and
rendered with the ``renderView()`` method. The ``registration.html.twig``
template might look something like this:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# app/Resources/views/Emails/registration.html.twig #}
    <h3>You did it! You registered!</h3>

    Hi {{ name }}! You're successfully registered.

    {# example, assuming you have a route named "login" #}
    To login, go to: <a href="{{ url('login') }}">...</a>.

    Thanks!

    {# Makes an absolute URL to the /images/logo.png file #}
    <img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('images/logo.png')) }}">

The ``$message`` object supports many more options, such as including attachments,
adding HTML content, and much more. Fortunately, Swift Mailer covers the topic
of `Creating Messages`_ in great detail in its documentation.
