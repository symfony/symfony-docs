How to Send an Email
====================

Symfony provides a mailer feature based on the popular `Swift Mailer`_ library
via the `SwiftMailerBundle`_. This mailer supports sending messages with your
own mail servers as well as using popular email providers like `Mandrill`_,
`SendGrid`_, and `Amazon SES`_.

Installation
------------

In applications using :doc:`Symfony Flex </setup/flex>`, run this command to
install the Swift Mailer based mailer before using it:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require mailer

If your application doesn't use Symfony Flex, follow the installation
instructions on `SwiftMailerBundle`_.

.. _swift-mailer-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

The ``config/packages/swiftmailer.yaml`` file that's created when installing the
mailer provides all the initial config needed to send emails, except your mail
server connection details. Those parameters are defined in the ``MAILER_URL``
environment variable in the ``.env`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    # use this to disable email delivery
    MAILER_URL=null://localhost

    # use this to configure a traditional SMTP server
    MAILER_URL=smtp://localhost:25?encryption=ssl&auth_mode=login&username=&password=

Refer to the :doc:`SwiftMailer configuration reference </reference/configuration/swiftmailer>`
for the detailed explanation of all the available config options.

Sending Emails
--------------

The Swift Mailer library works by creating, configuring and then sending
``Swift_Message`` objects. The "mailer" is responsible for the actual delivery
of the message and is accessible via the ``Swift_Mailer`` service. Overall,
sending an email is pretty straightforward::

    public function indexAction($name, \Swift_Mailer $mailer)
    {
        $message = (new \Swift_Message('Hello Email'))
            ->setFrom('send@example.com')
            ->setTo('recipient@example.com')
            ->setBody(
                $this->renderView(
                    // templates/emails/registration.html.twig
                    'emails/registration.html.twig',
                    array('name' => $name)
                ),
                'text/html'
            )
            /*
             * If you also want to include a plaintext version of the message
            ->addPart(
                $this->renderView(
                    'emails/registration.txt.twig',
                    array('name' => $name)
                ),
                'text/plain'
            )
            */
        ;

        $mailer->send($message);

        return $this->render(...);
    }

To keep things decoupled, the email body has been stored in a template and
rendered with the ``renderView()`` method. The ``registration.html.twig``
template might look something like this:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# templates/emails/registration.html.twig #}
    <h3>You did it! You registered!</h3>

    Hi {{ name }}! You're successfully registered.

    {# example, assuming you have a route named "login" #}
    To login, go to: <a href="{{ url('login') }}">...</a>.

    Thanks!

    {# Makes an absolute URL to the /images/logo.png file #}
    <img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('images/logo.png')) }}">

The ``$message`` object supports many more options, such as including attachments,
adding HTML content, and much more. Refer to the `Creating Messages`_ section
of the Swift Mailer documentation for more details.

.. _email-using-gmail:

Using Gmail to Send Emails
--------------------------

During development, you might prefer to send emails using Gmail instead of
setting up a regular SMTP server. To do that, update the ``MAILER_URL`` of your
``.env`` file to this:

.. code-block:: bash

    # username is your full Gmail or Google Apps email address
    MAILER_URL=gmail://username:password@localhost

The ``gmail`` transport is simply a shortcut that uses the ``smtp`` transport,
``ssl`` encryption, ``login`` auth mode and ``smtp.gmail.com`` host. If your app
uses other encryption or auth mode, you must override those values
(:doc:`see mailer config reference </reference/configuration/swiftmailer>`):

.. code-block:: bash

    # username is your full Gmail or Google Apps email address
    MAILER_URL=gmail://username:password@localhost?encryption=tls&auth_mode=oauth

If your Gmail account uses 2-Step-Verification, you must `generate an App password`_
and use it as the value of the mailer password. You must also ensure that you
`allow less secure apps to access your Gmail account`_.

Using Cloud Services to Send Emails
-----------------------------------

Cloud mailing services are a popular option for companies that don't want to set
up and maintain their own reliable mail servers. In Symfony apps, using these
services is as simple as updating the value of ``MAILER_URL`` in the ``.env``
file. For example, for `Amazon SES`_ (Simple Email Service):

.. code-block:: bash

    # The host will be different depending on your AWS zone
    # The username/password credentials are obtained from the Amazon SES console
    MAILER_URL=smtp://email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:587?encryption=tls&username=YOUR_SES_USERNAME&password=YOUR_SES_PASSWORD

Use the same technique for other mail services, as most of the time there is
nothing more to it than configuring an SMTP endpoint.
