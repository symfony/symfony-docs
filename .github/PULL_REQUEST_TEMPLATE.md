<!--

If your pull request fixes a BUG, use the oldest maintained branch that contains
the bug (see https://symfony.com/releases for the list of maintained branches).

If your pull request documents a NEW FEATURE, use the same Symfony branch where
the feature was introduced (and `6.x` for features of unreleased versions).

1. Suggestions for the Symfony Documentation Website
- Navbar Enhancements:
- Add Hover Effect: Apply a hover effect with a color change to the following navbar tabs: About, Documentation, Services. Similar to the existing hover effect on Blog and Download tabs.

- Footer Improvements:
- Change Footer Color: Update the yellow color in the footer to make it more visually appealing and complementary to the overall design.
- Simplify Footer Content: Reduce the details and content in the footer for a cleaner and more concise presentation.

2. Suggestions for the Symfony Components Page
- User-Friendly Component Navigation:
- Organize Components: Consider organizing the Symfony components in a user-friendly way that avoids excessive scrolling.
- Implement Pagination: Introduce a pagination system to navigate between different sets of components, making it easier for users to find the components they're looking for without scrolling extensively.
