<!--

If your pull request fixes a BUG, use the oldest maintained branch that contains
the bug (see https://symfony.com/releases for the list of maintained branches).

If your pull request documents a NEW FEATURE, use the same Symfony branch where
the feature was introduced (and `6.x` for features of unreleased versions).
