@demyanovs thanks for this contribution.

I haven't run the code shown on this page ... but the whole test code looks correct to me because of this:

Do you have the exact same code as in this test and the result is different? Thanks.

@javiereguiluz thanks for the response.
I relied on the code posted on this page and here we have another route
'_route' => 'is_leap_year / {year}'.
If you follow the documentation, then the condition on this page does not match.
