How to override Symfony's Default Directory Structure
=====================================================

Symfony automatically ships with a default directory structure. You can 
easily override this directory structure to create your own. The default 
directory structure is:

.. code-block:: text

    app/
        cache/
        config/
        logs/
        ...
    src/
        ...
    vendor/
        ...
    web/
        app.php
        ...

Override the ``cache`` directory
--------------------------------

You can override the cache directory by overriding the ``getCacheDir`` method 
in the ``AppKernel`` class of you application::

    // app/AppKernel.php

    // ...
    class AppKernel extends Kernel
    {
        // ...

        public function getCacheDir()
        {
            return $this->rootDir.'/'.$this->environment.'/cache/';
        }
    }

``$this->rootDir`` is the absolute path to the ``app`` directory and ``$this->environment``
is the current environment (i.e. ``dev``). In this case we have changed 
the location of the cache directory to ``app/{environment}/cache``.

.. warning::

    You should keep the ``cache`` directory different for each environment,
    otherwise some unexpected behaviour may happen. Each environment generates
    its own cached config files, and so each needs its own directory to store
    those cache files.

Override the ``logs`` directory
-------------------------------

Overriding the ``logs`` directory is the same as overriding the ``cache`` 
directory, the only difference is that you need to override the ``getLogDir`` 
method::

    // app/AppKernel.php

    // ...
    class AppKernel extends Kernel
    {
        // ...

        public function getLogDir()
        {
            return $this->rootDir.'/'.$this->environment.'/logs/';
        }
    }

Here we have changed the location of the directory to ``app/{environment}/logs``.

Override the ``web`` directory
------------------------------

If you need to rename or move your ``web`` directory, the only thing you
need to guarantee is that the path to the ``app`` directory is still correct
in your ``app.php`` and ``app_dev.php`` front controllers. If you simply
renamed the directory, you're fine. But if you moved it in some way, you
may need to modify the paths inside these files::

    require_once __DIR__.'/../Symfony/app/bootstrap.php.cache';
    require_once __DIR__.'/../Symfony/app/AppKernel.php';

.. tip::

    Some shared hosts have a ``public_html`` web directory root. Renaming
    your web directory from ``web`` to ``public_html`` is one way to make
    your Symfony project work on your shared host. Another way is to deploy
    your application to a directory outside of your web root, delete your
    ``public_html`` directory, and then replace it with a symbolic link to
    the ``web`` in your project.

.. note::

    If you use the AsseticBundle you need to configure this, so it can use 
    the correct ``web`` directory:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml

        # ...
        assetic:
            # ...
            read_from: "%kernel.root_dir%/../../public_html"

    Now you just need to dump the assets again and your application should 
    work:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console assetic:dump --env=prod --no-debug
