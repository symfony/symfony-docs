How to Test Code that Interacts with the Database
=================================================

If your code interacts with the database, e.g. reads data from or stores data
into it, you need to adjust your tests to take this into account. There are
many ways how to deal with this. In a unit test, you can create a mock for
a ``Repository`` and use it to return expected objects. In a functional test,
you may need to prepare a test database with predefined values to ensure that
your test always has the same data to work with.

.. note::

    If you want to test your queries directly, see :doc:`/cookbook/testing/doctrine`.

Mocking the ``Repository`` in a Unit Test
-----------------------------------------

If you want to test code which depends on a Doctrine repository in isolation,
you need to mock the ``Repository``. Normally you inject the ``EntityManager``
into your class and use it to get the repository. This makes things a little
more difficult as you need to mock both the ``EntityManager`` and your repository
class.

.. tip::

    It is possible (and a good idea) to inject your repository directly by
    registering your repository as a :doc:`factory service </components/dependency_injection/factories>`.
    This is a little bit more work to setup, but makes testing easier as you
    only need to mock the repository.

Suppose the class you want to test looks like this::

    namespace AppBundle\Salary;

    use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

    class SalaryCalculator
    {
        private $entityManager;

        public function __construct(ObjectManager $entityManager)
        {
            $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
        }

        public function calculateTotalSalary($id)
        {
            $employeeRepository = $this->entityManager
                ->getRepository('AppBundle:Employee');
            $employee = $employeeRepository->find($id);

            return $employee->getSalary() + $employee->getBonus();
        }
    }

Since the ``ObjectManager`` gets injected into the class through the constructor,
it's easy to pass a mock object within a test::

    use AppBundle\Salary\SalaryCalculator;

    class SalaryCalculatorTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        public function testCalculateTotalSalary()
        {
            // First, mock the object to be used in the test
            $employee = $this->getMock('\AppBundle\Entity\Employee');
            $employee->expects($this->once())
                ->method('getSalary')
                ->will($this->returnValue(1000));
            $employee->expects($this->once())
                ->method('getBonus')
                ->will($this->returnValue(1100));

            // Now, mock the repository so it returns the mock of the employee
            $employeeRepository = $this
                ->getMockBuilder('\Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository')
                ->disableOriginalConstructor()
                ->getMock();
            $employeeRepository->expects($this->once())
                ->method('find')
                ->will($this->returnValue($employee));

            // Last, mock the EntityManager to return the mock of the repository
            $entityManager = $this
                ->getMockBuilder('\Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager')
                ->disableOriginalConstructor()
                ->getMock();
            $entityManager->expects($this->once())
                ->method('getRepository')
                ->will($this->returnValue($employeeRepository));

            $salaryCalculator = new SalaryCalculator($entityManager);
            $this->assertEquals(2100, $salaryCalculator->calculateTotalSalary(1));
        }
    }

In this example, you are building the mocks from the inside out, first creating
the employee which gets returned by the ``Repository``, which itself gets
returned by the ``EntityManager``. This way, no real class is involved in
testing.

Changing Database Settings for Functional Tests
-----------------------------------------------

If you have functional tests, you want them to interact with a real database.
Most of the time you want to use a dedicated database connection to make sure
not to overwrite data you entered when developing the application and also
to be able to clear the database before every test.

To do this, you can specify a database configuration which overwrites the default
configuration:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config_test.yml
        doctrine:
            # ...
            dbal:
                host:     localhost
                dbname:   testdb
                user:     testdb
                password: testdb

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config_test.xml -->
        <doctrine:config>
            <doctrine:dbal
                host="localhost"
                dbname="testdb"
                user="testdb"
                password="testdb"
            />
        </doctrine:config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config_test.php
        $configuration->loadFromExtension('doctrine', array(
            'dbal' => array(
                'host'     => 'localhost',
                'dbname'   => 'testdb',
                'user'     => 'testdb',
                'password' => 'testdb',
            ),
        ));

Make sure that your database runs on localhost and has the defined database and
user credentials set up.
