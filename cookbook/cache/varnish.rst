How to use Varnish to speed up my Website
=========================================

Because Symfony2's cache uses the standard HTTP cache headers, the
:ref:`symfony-gateway-cache` can easily be replaced with any other reverse
proxy. Varnish is a powerful, open-source, HTTP accelerator capable of serving
cached content quickly and including support for :ref:`Edge Side
Includes<edge-side-includes>`.

Configuration
-------------

As seen previously, Symfony2 is smart enough to detect whether it talks to a
reverse proxy that understands ESI or not. It works out of the box when you
use the Symfony2 reverse proxy, but you need a special configuration to make
it work with Varnish. Thankfully, Symfony2 relies on yet another standard
written by AkamaÃ¯ (`Edge Architecture`_), so the configuration tips in this
chapter can be useful even if you don't use Symfony2.

.. note::

    Varnish only supports the ``src`` attribute for ESI tags (``onerror`` and
    ``alt`` attributes are ignored).

First, configure Varnish so that it advertises its ESI support by adding a
``Surrogate-Capability`` header to requests forwarded to the backend
application:

.. code-block:: text

    sub vcl_recv {
        // Add a Surrogate-Capability header to announce ESI support.
        set req.http.Surrogate-Capability = "abc=ESI/1.0";
    }

Then, optimize Varnish so that it only parses the Response contents when there
is at least one ESI tag by checking the ``Surrogate-Control`` header that
Symfony2 adds automatically:

.. code-block:: text

    sub vcl_fetch {
        /*
        Check for ESI acknowledgement
        and remove Surrogate-Control header
        */
        if (beresp.http.Surrogate-Control ~ "ESI/1.0") {
            unset beresp.http.Surrogate-Control;

            // For Varnish >= 3.0
            set beresp.do_esi = true;
            // For Varnish < 3.0
            // esi;
        }
    }

.. caution::

    Compression with ESI was not supported in Varnish until version 3.0
    (read `GZIP and Varnish`_). If you're not using Varnish 3.0, put a web
    server in front of Varnish to perform the compression.

.. index::
    single: Varnish; Invalidation

Cache Invalidation
------------------

You should never need to invalidate cached data because invalidation is already
taken into account natively in the HTTP cache models (see :ref:`http-cache-invalidation`).

Still, Varnish can be configured to accept a special HTTP ``PURGE`` method
that will invalidate the cache for a given resource:

.. code-block:: text

    /*
     Connect to the backend server
     on the local machine on port 8080
     */
    backend default {
        .host = "127.0.0.1";
        .port = "8080";
    }

    sub vcl_recv {
        /*
        Varnish default behaviour doesn't support PURGE.
        Match the PURGE request and immediately do a cache lookup,
        otherwise Varnish will directly pipe the request to the backend
        and bypass the cache
        */
        if (req.request == "PURGE") {
            return(lookup);
        }
    }

    sub vcl_hit {
        // Match PURGE request
        if (req.request == "PURGE") {
            // Force object expiration for Varnish < 3.0
            set obj.ttl = 0s;
            // Do an actual purge for Varnish >= 3.0
            // purge;
            error 200 "Purged";
        }
    }

    sub vcl_miss {
        /*
        Match the PURGE request and
        indicate the request wasn't stored in cache.
        */
        if (req.request == "PURGE") {
            error 404 "Not purged";
        }
    }

.. caution::

    You must protect the ``PURGE`` HTTP method somehow to avoid random people
    purging your cached data. You can do this by setting up an access list:

    .. code-block:: text

        /*
         Connect to the backend server
         on the local machine on port 8080
         */
        backend default {
            .host = "127.0.0.1";
            .port = "8080";
        }

        // Acl's can contain IP's, subnets and hostnames
        acl purge {
            "localhost";
            "192.168.55.0"/24;
        }

        sub vcl_recv {
            // Match PURGE request to avoid cache bypassing
            if (req.request == "PURGE") {
                // Match client IP to the acl
                if (!client.ip ~ purge) {
                    // Deny access
                    error 405 "Not allowed.";
                }
                // Perform a cache lookup
                return(lookup);
            }
        }

        sub vcl_hit {
            // Match PURGE request
            if (req.request == "PURGE") {
                // Force object expiration for Varnish < 3.0
                set obj.ttl = 0s;
                // Do an actual purge for Varnish >= 3.0
                // purge;
                error 200 "Purged";
            }
        }

        sub vcl_miss {
            // Match PURGE request
            if (req.request == "PURGE") {
                // Indicate that the object isn't stored in cache
                error 404 "Not purged";
            }
        }
