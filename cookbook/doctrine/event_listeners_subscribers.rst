Registering Event Listeners and Subscribers
===========================================

Doctrine packages a rich event system that fires events when almost anything
happens inside the system. For you, this means that you can create arbitrary
:doc:`services</book/service_container>` and tell Doctrine to notify those
objects whenever a certain action (e.g. ``prePersist``) happens within Doctrine.
This could be useful, for example, to create an independent search index
whenever an object in your database is saved.

Doctrine defines two types of objects that can listen to Doctrine events:
listeners and subscribers. Both are very similar, but listeners are a bit
more straightforward. For more, see `The Event System`_ on Doctrine's website.

Configuring the Listener/Subscriber
-----------------------------------

To register a service to act as an event listener or subscriber you just have
to :ref:`tag<book-service-container-tags>` it with the appropriate name. Depending
on your use-case, you can hook a listener into every DBAL connection and ORM
entity manager or just into one specific DBAL connection and all the entity
managers that use this connection.

                </service>
            </services>
        </container>

Creating the Listener Class
---------------------------

In the previous example, a service ``my.listener`` was configured as a Doctrine
listener on the event ``postPersist``. That class behind that service must have
a ``postPersist`` method, which will be called when the event is thrown::

    // src/Acme/SearchBundle/Listener/SearchIndexer.php
    namespace Acme\SearchBundle\Listener;

    use Doctrine\ORM\Event\LifecycleEventArgs;
    use Acme\StoreBundle\Entity\Product;

    class SearchIndexer
    {
        public function postPersist(LifecycleEventArgs $args)
        {
            $entity = $args->getEntity();
            $entityManager = $args->getEntityManager();

            // perhaps you only want to act on some "Product" entity
            if ($entity instanceof Product) {
                // do something with the Product
            }
        }
    }

In each event, you have access to a ``LifecycleEventArgs`` object, which
gives you access to both the entity object of the event and the entity manager
itself.

One important thing to notice is that a listener will be listening for *all*
entities in your application. So, if you're interested in only handling a
specific type of entity (e.g. a ``Product`` entity but not a ``BlogPost``
entity), you should check for the class name of the entity in your method
(as shown above).
