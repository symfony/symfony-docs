How to Override any Part of a Bundle
====================================

This article has not been written yet, but will soon. If you're interested
in writing this entry, see :doc:`/contributing/documentation/overview`.

This topic is meant to show how you can override each and every part of a
bundle, both from your application and from other bundles. This may include:

* Templates
* Routing
* Controllers
* Services & Configuration
* Entities & Entity mapping
* Forms
* Validation metadata

In some cases, this may talk about the best practices that a bundle must
use in order for certain pieces to be overridable (or easily overridable).
We may also talk about how certain pieces *aren't* really overridable, but
your best approach at solving your problems anyways.
