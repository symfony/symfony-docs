How to Use Data Transformers
============================

You'll often find the need to transform the data the user entered in a form into
something else for use in your program. You could easily do this manually in your
controller, but what if you want to use this specific form in different places?

Say you have a one-to-one relation of Task to Issue, e.g. a Task optionally has an
issue linked to it. Adding a listbox with all possible issues can eventually lead to
a really long listbox in which it is impossible to find something. You might
want to add a textbox instead, where the user can simply enter the issue number.

You could try to do this in your controller, but it's not the best solution.
It would be better if this issue were automatically converted to an Issue object.
This is where Data Transformers come into play.

.. caution::

    When a form field has the ``inherit_data`` option set, Data Transformers
    won't be applied to that field.

Creating the Transformer
------------------------

First, create an ``IssueToNumberTransformer`` class - this class will be responsible
for converting to and from the issue number and the ``Issue`` object::

    // src/AppBundle/Form/DataTransformer/IssueToNumberTransformer.php
    namespace AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer;

    use AppBundle\Entity\Issue;
    use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\DataTransformerInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\Exception\TransformationFailedException;

    class IssueToNumberTransformer implements DataTransformerInterface
    {
        /**
         * @var ObjectManager
         */
        private $om;

        /**
         * @param ObjectManager $om
         */
        public function __construct(ObjectManager $om)
        {
            $this->om = $om;
        }

        /**
         * Transforms an object (issue) to a string (number).
         *
         * @param  Issue|null $issue
         * @return string
         */
        public function transform($issue)
        {
            if (null === $issue) {
                return '';
            }

            return $issue->getNumber();
        }

        /**
         * Transforms a string (number) to an object (issue).
         *
         * @param  string $number
         * @return Issue|null
         * @throws TransformationFailedException if object (issue) is not found.
         */
        public function reverseTransform($number)
        {
            if (!$number) {
                return null;
            }

            $issue = $this->om
                ->getRepository('AppBundle:Issue')
                ->findOneBy(array('number' => $number))
            ;

            if (null === $issue) {
                throw new TransformationFailedException(sprintf(
                    'An issue with number "%s" does not exist!',
                    $number
                ));
            }

            return $issue;
        }
    }

.. tip::

    If you want a new issue to be created when an unknown number is entered, you
    can instantiate it rather than throwing the ``TransformationFailedException``.

.. note::

    When ``null`` is passed to the ``transform()`` method, your transformer
    should return an equivalent value of the type it is transforming to (e.g.
    an empty string, 0 for integers or 0.0 for floats).

Using the Transformer
---------------------

As seen above our transformer requires an instance of an object manager. While for most
use-cases it is sufficient to use the default entity manager, you will sometimes need
to explicitly choose the one to use. To achieve this, you can use a factory::

    // src/AppBundle/Form/DataTransformer/IssueToNumberTransformerFactory.php
    namespace AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer;

    use Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\ManagerRegistry;

    class IssueToNumberTransformerFactory
    {
        /** 
         * @var ManagerRegistry 
         */
        private $registry;

        public function __construct(ManagerRegistry $registry)
        {
            $this->registry = $registry;
        }

        public function create($om)
        {
            return new IssueToNumberTransformer($this->registry->getManager($om));
        }
    }

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        services:
            app.issue_transformer_factory:
                class: AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer\IssueToNumberTransformerFactory
                arguments: ["@doctrine"]
                public: false
                
            app.type.task:
                class: AppBundle\Form\TaskType
                arguments: ["@app.issue_transformer_factory"]
                tag:
                  - { name: form.type, alias: app_task }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <service id="app.issue_transformer_factory" class="AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer\IssueToNumberTransformerFactory" public="false">
            <argument type="service" id="doctrine"/>
        </service>
        
        <service id="app.type.task" class="AppBundle\Form\TaskType">
            <argument type="service" id="app.issue_transformer_factory"/>
            <tag name="form.type" alias="app_task"/>
        </service>

    .. code-block:: php

        $container
            ->setDefinition('app.issue_transformer_factory', new Definition(
                'AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer\IssueToNumberTransformerFactory'
                ), array(
                new Reference('doctrine'),
            ))
            ->setPublic(false)
        ;
        
        $container
            ->setDefinition('app.type.task', new Definition(
                'AppBundle\Form\TaskType'
                ), array(
                new Reference('app.issue_transformer_factory'),
            ))
            ->addTag('form.type', array('alias' => 'app_task'))
        ;
    
Now that you have capability to build the transformer with the desired object manager, you
just need to create it from your issue field in some form.

You can also use transformers without creating a new custom form type
by calling ``addModelTransformer`` (or ``addViewTransformer`` - see
`Model and View Transformers`_) on any field builder::

    // src/AppBundle/Form/TaskType.php
    namespace AppBundle\Form;

    use AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer\IssueToNumberTransformerFactory;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\OptionsResolver\OptionsResolverInterface;

    class TaskType extends AbstractType
    {
        /** 
         * @var IssueToNumberTransformerFactory 
         */
        private $factory;

        public function __construct(IssueToNumberTransformerFactory $factory)
        {
            $this->factory = $factory;
        }

        public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
        {
            $transformer = $this->factory->create($options['om']);

            $builder->add(
                $builder->create('issue', 'text')
                    ->addModelTransformer($transformer)
            );
        }

        public function setDefaultOptions(OptionsResolverInterface $resolver)
        {
            $resolver
                ->setDefaults(array(
                    'data_class' => 'AppBundle\Entity\Task',
                ))
                ->setRequired(array('om'))
            ;
        }
    }

This example requires that you pass in the entity manager as an option
when creating your form. Later, you'll learn how you could create a custom
``issue`` field type to avoid needing to do this in your controller::

    $taskForm = $this->createForm('app_task', $task, array(
        'om' => 'default',
    ));

Cool, you're done! Your user will be able to enter an issue number into the
text field and it will be transformed back into an Issue object. This means
that, after a successful submission, the Form component will pass a real
``Issue`` object to ``Task::setIssue()`` instead of the issue number.

If the issue isn't found, a form error will be created for that field and
its error message can be controlled with the ``invalid_message`` field option.

.. caution::

    Notice that adding a transformer requires using a slightly more complicated
    syntax when adding the field. The following is **wrong**, as the transformer
    would be applied to the entire form, instead of just this field::

        // THIS IS WRONG - TRANSFORMER WILL BE APPLIED TO THE ENTIRE FORM
        // see above example for correct code
        $builder->add('issue', 'text')
            ->addModelTransformer($transformer);

Model and View Transformers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the above example, the transformer was used as a "model" transformer.
In fact, there are two different types of transformers and three different
types of underlying data.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/form/DataTransformersTypes.png
   :align: center

In any form, the three different types of data are:

1) **Model data** - This is the data in the format used in your application
   (e.g. an ``Issue`` object). If you call ``Form::getData`` or ``Form::setData``,
   you're dealing with the "model" data.

2) **Norm Data** - This is a normalized version of your data, and is commonly
   the same as your "model" data (though not in our example). It's not commonly
   used directly.

3) **View Data** - This is the format that's used to fill in the form fields
   themselves. It's also the format in which the user will submit the data. When
   you call ``Form::submit($data)``, the ``$data`` is in the "view" data format.

The two different types of transformers help convert to and from each of these
types of data:

**Model transformers**:
    - ``transform``: "model data" => "norm data"
    - ``reverseTransform``: "norm data" => "model data"

**View transformers**:
    - ``transform``: "norm data" => "view data"
    - ``reverseTransform``: "view data" => "norm data"

Which transformer you need depends on your situation.

To use the view transformer, call ``addViewTransformer``.

So why Use the Model Transformer?
---------------------------------

In this example, the field is a ``text`` field, and a text field is always
expected to be a simple, scalar format in the "norm" and "view" formats. For
this reason, the most appropriate transformer was the "model" transformer
(which converts to/from the *norm* format - string issue number - to the *model*
format - Issue object).

The difference between the transformers is subtle and you should always think
about what the "norm" data for a field should really be. For example, the
"norm" data for a ``text`` field is a string, but is a ``DateTime`` object
for a ``date`` field.

Using Transformers in a custom Field Type
-----------------------------------------

In the above example, you applied the transformer to a normal ``text`` field.
This was easy, but has two downsides:

1) You need to always remember to apply the transformer whenever you're adding
a field for issue numbers.

2) You need to worry about passing in the ``em`` option whenever you're creating
a form that uses the transformer.

Because of these, you may choose to :doc:`create a custom field type </cookbook/form/create_custom_field_type>`.
First, create the custom field type class::

    // src/AppBundle/Form/IssueSelectorType.php
    namespace AppBundle\Form;

    use AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer\IssueToNumberTransformerFactory;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\OptionsResolver\OptionsResolverInterface;

    class IssueSelectorType extends AbstractType
    {
        private $factory;
        
        public function __construct(IssueToNumberTransformerFactory $factory)
        {
            $this->factory = $factory;
        }

        public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
        {
            $transformer = $this->factory->create($options['om']);
            $builder->addModelTransformer($transformer);
        }

        public function setDefaultOptions(OptionsResolverInterface $resolver)
        {
            $resolver->setDefaults(array(
                'invalid_message' => 'The selected issue does not exist',
                'om' => 'default'
            ));
        }

        public function getParent()
        {
            return 'text';
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return 'issue_selector';
        }
    }

Next, register your type as a service and tag it with ``form.type`` so that
it's recognized as a custom field type:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        services:
            app.issue_transformer_factory:
                class: AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer\IssueToNumberTransformerFactory
                arguments: ["@doctrine"]
                public: false
            app.type.issue_selector:
                class: AppBundle\Form\IssueSelectorType
                arguments: ["@app.issue_transformer_factory"]
                tags:
                    - { name: form.type, alias: issue_selector }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <service id="app.issue_transformer_factory" class="AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer\IssueToNumberTransformerFactory" public="false">
            <argument type="service" id="doctrine"/>
        </service>
        
        <service id="app.type.issue_selector" class="AppBundle\Form\IssueSelectorType">
            <argument type="service" id="app.issue_transformer_factory"/>
            <tag name="form.type" alias="issue_selector" />
        </service>

    .. code-block:: php

        $container
            ->setDefinition('app.issue_transformer_factory', new Definition(
                'AppBundle\Form\DataTransformer\IssueToNumberTransformerFactory'
                ), array(
                new Reference('doctrine'),
            ))
            ->setPublic(false)
        ;
        
        $container
            ->setDefinition('app.type.issue_selector', new Definition(
                'AppBundle\Form\IssueSelectorType'
                ), array(
                new Reference('app.issue_transformer_factory'),
            ))
            ->addTag('form.type', array(
                'alias' => 'issue_selector',
            ))
        ;

Now, whenever you need to use your special ``issue_selector`` field type,
it's quite easy::

    // src/AppBundle/Form/TaskType.php
    namespace AppBundle\Form;

    use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;

    class TaskType extends AbstractType
    {
        public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
        {
            $builder
                ->add('task')
                ->add('dueDate', null, array('widget' => 'single_text'))
                ->add('issue', 'issue_selector');
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return 'task';
        }
    }
