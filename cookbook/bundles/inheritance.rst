How to use Bundle Inheritance to Override parts of a Bundle
===========================================================

When working with third-party bundles, you'll probably come across a situation
where you want to override a file in that third-party bundle with a file
in one of your own bundles. Symfony gives you a very convenient way to override
things like controllers, templates, and other files in a bundle's
``Resources/`` directory.

For example, suppose that you're installing the `FOSUserBundle`_, but you
want to override its base ``layout.html.twig`` template, as well as one of
its controllers. Suppose also that you have your own ``AcmeUserBundle``
where you want the overridden files to live. Start by registering the ``FOSUserBundle``
as the "parent" of your bundle::

    // src/Acme/UserBundle/AcmeUserBundle.php
    namespace Acme\UserBundle;

    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Bundle\Bundle;

    class AcmeUserBundle extends Bundle
    {
        public function getParent()
        {
            return 'FOSUserBundle';
        }
    }

By making this simple change, you can now override several parts of the ``FOSUserBundle``
simply by creating a file with the same name.

.. note::

    Despite the method name, there is no parent/child relationship between 
    the bundles, it is just a way to extend and override an existing bundle.

Overriding Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose you want to add some functionality to the ``registerAction`` of a
``RegistrationController`` that lives inside ``FOSUserBundle``. To do so,
just create your own ``RegistrationController.php`` file, override the bundle's
original method, and change its functionality::

    // src/Acme/UserBundle/Controller/RegistrationController.php
    namespace Acme\UserBundle\Controller;

    use FOS\UserBundle\Controller\RegistrationController as BaseController;

    class RegistrationController extends BaseController
    {
        public function registerAction()
        {
            $response = parent::registerAction();

            // ... do custom stuff
            return $response;
        }
    }

.. tip::

    Depending on how severely you need to change the behavior, you might
    call ``parent::registerAction()`` or completely replace its logic with
    your own.

.. note::

    Overriding controllers in this way only works if the bundle refers to
    the controller using the standard ``FOSUserBundle:Registration:register``
    syntax in routes and templates. This is the best practice.

Overriding Resources: Templates, Routing, Validation, etc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most resources can also be overridden, simply by creating a file in the same
location as your parent bundle.

For example, it's very common to need to override the ``FOSUserBundle``'s
``layout.html.twig`` template so that it uses your application's base layout.
Since the file lives at ``Resources/views/layout.html.twig`` in the ``FOSUserBundle``,
you can create your own file in the same location of ``AcmeUserBundle``.
Symfony will ignore the file that lives inside the ``FOSUserBundle`` entirely,
and use your file instead.

The same goes for routing files, validation configuration and other resources.

.. note::

    The overriding of resources only works when you refer to resources with
    the ``@FosUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/security.xml`` method.
    If you refer to resources without using the @BundleName shortcut, they
    can't be overridden in this way.

.. caution::

   Translation files do not work in the same way as described above. All
   translation files are accumulated into a set of "pools" (one for each)
   domain. Symfony loads translation files from bundles first (in the order
   that the bundles are initialized) and then from your ``app/Resources``
   directory. If the same translation is specified in two resources, the
   translation from the resource that's loaded last will win.
