   single: Deployment; Deploying to Microsoft Azure Website Cloud

Deploying to Microsoft Azure Website Cloud
==========================================

This step by step cookbook describes how to deploy a small Symfony web
application to the Microsoft Azure Website cloud platform. It will explain how
to setup a new Azure website including configuring the right PHP version and
global environment variables. The document also shows how to you can leverage
Git and Composer to deploy your Symfony application to the cloud.

Setting up the Azure Website
----------------------------

To setup a new Microsoft Azure Website, first `signup with Azure`_ or sign in
with your credentials. Once you're connected to your `Azure Portal`_ interface,
scroll down to the bottom and select the **New** panel. On this panel, click
**Web Site** and choose **Custom Create**:

Step 1: Create Web Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, you will be prompted to fill in some basic information.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-02.png
   :alt: Setup the Azure Website

For the URL, enter the URL that you would like to use for your Symfony application,
then pick **Create new web hosting plan** in the region you want. By default, a
*free 20 MB SQL database* is selected in the database dropdown list. In this
tutorial, the Symfony app will connect to a MySQL database. Pick the
**Create a new MySQL database** option in the dropdown list. You can keep
the **DefaultConnection** string name. Finally, check the box
**Publish from source control** to enable a Git repository and go to the
next step.

Step 2: New MySQL Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On this step, you will be prompted to setup your MySQL database storage with a
database name and a region. The MySQL database storage is provided by Microsoft
in partnership with ClearDB. Choose the same region you selected for the hosting
plan configuration in the previous step.

   :alt: Setup the MySQL database

Agree to the terms and conditions and click on the right arrow to continue.

Step 3: Where Is your Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, on the third step, select a **Local Git repository** item and click
on the right arrow to configure your Azure Website credentials.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-04.png
   :alt: Setup a local Git repository

Step 4: New Username and Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Great! You're now on the final step. Create a username and a secure password:
these will become essential identifiers to connect to the FTP server and
also to push your application code to the Git repository.

   :alt: Configure Azure Website credentials

Congratulations! Your Azure Website is now up and running. You can check
it by browsing to the Website url you configured in the first step. You should
see the following display in your web browser:

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-06.png
   :alt: Azure Website is running

The Microsoft Azure portal also provides a complete control panel for the Azure
Website.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-07.png
   :alt: Azure Website Control Panel

Your Azure Website is ready! But to run a Symfony site, you need to configure
just a few additional things.

Configuring the Azure Website for Symfony
-----------------------------------------

This section of the tutorial details how to configure the correct version of PHP
to run Symfony. It also shows you how to enable some mandatory PHP extensions
and how to properly configure PHP for a production environment.

Configuring the latest PHP Runtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though Symfony only requires PHP 5.3.3 to run, it's always recommended
to use the most recent PHP version whenever possible. PHP 5.3 is no longer
supported by the PHP core team, but you can update it easily in Azure.

To update your PHP version on Azure, go to the **Configure** tab of the control
panel and select the version you want.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-08.png
   :alt: Enabling the most recent PHP runtime from Azure Website Control Panel

Click the **Save** button in the bottom bar to save your changes and restart
the web server.

.. note::

    Choosing a more recent PHP version can greatly improve runtime performance.
    PHP 5.5 ships with a new built-in PHP accelerator called OPCache that
    replaces APC. On an Azure Website, OPCache is already enabled and there
    is no need to install and setup APC.

    The following screenshot shows the output of a :phpfunction:`phpinfo` script
    run from an Azure Website to verify that PHP 5.5 is running with
    OPCache enabled.

    .. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-09.png
       :alt: OPCache Configuration

Tweaking php.ini Configuration Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Microsoft Azure allows you to override the ``php.ini`` global configuration
settings by creating a custom ``.user.ini`` file under the project root
directory (``site/wwwroot``).

.. code-block:: ini

    ; .user.ini
    expose_php = Off
    memory_limit = 256M
    upload_max_filesize = 10M

None of these settings *needs* to be overridden. The default PHP configuration
is already pretty good, so this is just an example to show how you can easily
tweak PHP internal settings by uploading your custom ``.ini`` file.

You can either manually create this file on your Azure Website FTP server under
the ``site/wwwroot`` directory or deploy it with Git. You can get your FTP
server credentials from the Azure Website Control panel under the **Dashboard**
tab on the right sidebar. If you want to use Git, simply put your ``.user.ini``
file at the root of your local repository and push your commits to your Azure
Website repository.

.. note::

    This cookbook has a section dedicated to explaining how to configure your
    Azure Website Git repository and how to push the commits to be deployed. See
    `Deploying from Git`_. You can also learn more about configuring PHP
    internal settings on the official `PHP MSDN documentation`_ page.

Enabling the PHP intl Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the tricky part of the guide! At the time of writing this cookbook,
Microsoft Azure Website provided the ``intl`` extension, but it's not enabled
by default. To enable the ``intl`` extension, there is no need to upload
any DLL files as the ``php_intl.dll`` file already exists on Azure. In fact,
this file just needs to be moved into the custom website extension directory.

.. note::

    The Microsoft Azure team is currently working on enabling the ``intl`` PHP
    extension by default. In the near future, the following steps will no
    longer be necessary.

To get the ``php_intl.dll`` file under your ``site/wwwroot`` directory, simply
access the online **Kudu** tool by browsing to the following url:

.. code-block:: text

    https://[your-website-name].scm.azurewebsites.net

**Kudu** is a set of tools to manage your application. It comes with a file
explorer, a command line prompt, a log stream and a configuration settings summary
page. Of course, this section can only be accessed if you're logged in to
your main Azure Website account.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-10.png
   :alt: The Kudu Panel

From the Kudu front page, click on the **Debug Console** navigation item in the
main menu and choose **CMD**. This should open the **Debug Console** page
that shows a file explorer and a console prompt below.

In the console prompt, type the following three commands to copy the original
``php_intl.dll`` extension file into a custom website ``ext/`` directory. This
new directory must be created under the main directory ``site/wwwroot``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd site\wwwroot
    $ mkdir ext
    $ copy "D:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\v5.5\ext\php_intl.dll" ext

The whole process and output should look like this:

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-11.png
   :alt: Executing commands in the online Kudu Console prompt

To complete the activation of the ``php_intl.dll`` extension, you must tell
Azure Website to load it from the newly created ``ext`` directory. This can be
done by registering a global ``PHP_EXTENSIONS`` environment variable from
the **Configure** tab of the main Azure Website Control panel.

In the **app settings** section, register the ``PHP_EXTENSIONS`` environment
variable with the value ``ext\php_intl.dll`` as shown in the screenshot below:

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-12.png
   :alt: Registering custom PHP extensions

Hit "save" to confirm your changes and restart the web server. The PHP ``Intl``
extension should now be available in your web server environment. The following
screenshot of a :phpfunction:`phpinfo` page verifies the ``intl`` extension is
properly enabled:

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-13.png
   :alt: Intl extension is enabled

Great! The PHP environment setup is now complete. Next, you'll learn how
to configure the Git repository and push code to production. You'll also
learn how to install and configure the Symfony app after it's deployed.

Deploying from Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure Git is correctly installed on your local machine using the
following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git --version

.. note::

    Get your Git from the `git-scm.com`_ website and follow the instructions
    to install and configure it on your local machine.

In the Azure Website Control panel, browse the **Deployment** tab to get the
Git repository URL where you should push your code:

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-14.png
   :alt: Git deployment panel

Now, you'll want to connect your local Symfony application with this remote
Git repository on Azure Website. If your Symfony application is not yet stored
with Git, you must first create a Git repository in your Symfony application
directory with the ``git init`` command and commit to it with the ``git commit``
command.

Also, make sure your Symfony repository has a ``.gitignore`` file at its root
directory with at least the following contents:

.. code-block:: text

    /app/bootstrap.php.cache
    /app/cache/*
    /app/config/parameters.yml
    /app/logs/*
    !app/cache/.gitkeep
    !app/logs/.gitkeep
    /app/SymfonyRequirements.php
    /build/
    /vendor/
    /bin/
    /composer.phar
    /web/app_dev.php
    /web/bundles/
    /web/config.php

The ``.gitignore`` file asks Git not to track any of the files and directories
that match these patterns. This means these files won't be deployed to the Azure
Website.

Now, from the command line on your local machine, type the following at the
root of your Symfony project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git remote add azure https://<username>@<your-website-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net:443/<your-website-name>.git
    $ git push azure master

Don't forget to replace the values enclosed by ``<`` and ``>`` with your custom
settings displayed in the **Deployment** tab of your Azure Website panel. The
``git remote`` command connects the Azure Website remote Git repository and
assigns an alias to it with the name ``azure``. The second ``git push`` command
pushes all your commits to the remote ``master`` branch of your remote ``azure``
Git repository.

The deployment with Git should produce an output similar to the screenshot
below:

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-15.png
   :alt: Deploying files to the Git Azure Website repository

The code of the Symfony application has now been deployed to the Azure Website
which you can browse from the file explorer of the Kudu application. You should
see the ``app/``, ``src/`` and ``web/`` directories under your ``site/wwwroot``
directory on the Azure Website filesystem.

Configure the Symfony Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHP has been configured and your code has been pushed with Git. The last
step is to configure the application and install the third party dependencies
it requires that aren't tracked by Git. Switch back to the online **Console**
of the Kudu application and execute the following commands in it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd site\wwwroot
    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php -d extension=php_intl.dll composer.phar install

The ``curl`` command retrieves and downloads the Composer command line tool and
installs it at the root of the ``site/wwwroot`` directory. Then, running
the Composer ``install`` command downloads and installs all necessary third-party
libraries.

This may take a while depending on the number of third-party dependencies
you've configured in your ``composer.json`` file.

.. note::

    The ``-d`` switch allows you to quickly override/add any ``php.ini`` settings.
    In this command, we are forcing PHP to use the ``intl`` extension, because
    it is not enabled by default in Azure Website at the moment. Soon, this
    ``-d`` option will no longer be needed since Microsoft will enable the
    ``intl`` extension by default.

At the end of the ``composer install`` command, you will be prompted to fill in
the values of some Symfony settings like database credentials, locale, mailer
credentials, CSRF token protection, etc. These parameters come from the
``app/config/parameters.yml.dist`` file.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-16.png
   :alt: Configuring Symfony global parameters

The most important thing in this cookbook is to correctly setup your database
settings. You can get your MySQL database settings on the right sidebar of the
**Azure Website Dashboard** panel. Simply click on the
**View Connection Strings** link to make them appear in a pop-in.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-17.png
   :alt: MySQL database settings

The displayed MySQL database settings should be something similar to the code
below. Of course, each value depends on what you've already configured.

.. code-block:: text

    Database=mysymfonyMySQL;Data Source=eu-cdbr-azure-north-c.cloudapp.net;User Id=bff2481a5b6074;Password=bdf50b42

Switch back to the console and answer the prompted questions and provide the
following answers. Don't forget to adapt the values below with your real values
from the MySQL connection string.

.. code-block:: text

    database_driver: pdo_mysql
    database_host: u-cdbr-azure-north-c.cloudapp.net
    database_port: null
    database_name: mysymfonyMySQL
    database_user: bff2481a5b6074
    database_password: bdf50b42
    // ...

Don't forget to answer all the questions. It's important to set a unique random
string for the ``secret`` variable. For the mailer configuration, Azure Website
doesn't provide a built-in mailer service. You should consider configuring
the host-name and credentials of some other third-party mailing service if
your application needs to send emails.

.. image:: /images/cookbook/deployment/azure-website/step-18.png
   :alt: Configuring Symfony

Your Symfony application is now configured and should be almost operational. The
final step is to build the database schema. This can easily be done with the
command line interface if you're using Doctrine. In the online **Console** tool
of the Kudu application, run the following command to mount the tables into your
MySQL database.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force

This command builds the tables and indexes for your MySQL database. If your
Symfony application is more complex than a basic Symfony Standard Edition, you
may have additional commands to execute for setup (see :doc:`/cookbook/deployment/tools`).

Make sure that your application is running by browsing the ``app.php`` front
controller with your web browser and the following url:

.. code-block:: bash

    http://<your-website-name>.azurewebsites.net/web/app.php

If Symfony is correctly installed, you should see the front page of your Symfony
application showing.

Configure the Web Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, the Symfony application has been deployed and works perfectly on
the Azure Website. However, the ``web`` folder is still part of the url, which
you definitely don't want. But don't worry! You can easily configure the web
server to point to the ``web`` folder and remove the ``web`` in the URL (and
guarantee that nobody can access files outside of the ``web`` directory.)

To do this, create and deploy (see previous section about Git) the following
``web.config`` file. This file must be located at the root of your project
next to the ``composer.json`` file. This file is the Microsoft IIS Server
equivalent to the well-known ``.htaccess`` file from Apache. For a Symfony
application, configure it with the following content:

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- web.config -->
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <configuration>
      <system.webServer>
        <rewrite>
          <rules>
            <clear />
            <rule name="BlockAccessToPublic" patternSyntax="Wildcard" stopProcessing="true">
              <match url="*" />
              <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll" trackAllCaptures="false">
                <add input="{URL}" pattern="/web/*" />
              </conditions>
              <action type="CustomResponse" statusCode="403" statusReason="Forbidden: Access is denied." statusDescription="You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials that you supplied." />
            </rule>
            <rule name="RewriteAssetsToPublic" stopProcessing="true">
              <match url="^(.*)(\.css|\.js|\.jpg|\.png|\.gif)$" />
              <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll" trackAllCaptures="false">
              </conditions>
              <action type="Rewrite" url="web/{R:0}" />
            </rule>
            <rule name="RewriteRequestsToPublic" stopProcessing="true">
              <match url="^(.*)$" />
              <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll" trackAllCaptures="false">
              </conditions>
              <action type="Rewrite" url="web/app.php/{R:0}" />
            </rule>
          </rules>
        </rewrite>
      </system.webServer>
    </configuration>

As you can see, the latest rule ``RewriteRequestsToPublic`` is responsible for
rewriting any urls to the ``web/app.php`` front controller which allows you to
skip the ``web/`` folder in the URL. The first rule called ``BlockAccessToPublic``
matches all url patterns that contain the ``web/`` folder and serves a
``403 Forbidden`` HTTP response instead. This example is based on Benjamin
Eberlei's sample you can find on GitHub in the `SymfonyAzureEdition`_ bundle.

Deploy this file under the ``site/wwwroot`` directory of the Azure Website and
browse to your application without the ``web/app.php`` segment in the URL.

Conclusion
----------

Nice work! You've now deployed your Symfony application to the Microsoft
Azure Website Cloud platform. You also saw that Symfony can be easily configured
and executed on a Microsoft IIS web server. The process is simple and easy
to implement. And as a bonus, Microsoft is continuing to reduce the number
of steps needed so that deployment becomes even easier.
