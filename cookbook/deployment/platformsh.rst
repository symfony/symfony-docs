Deploying to Platform.sh
========================

This step-by-step cookbook describes how to deploy a Symfony web application to
`Platform.sh`_. You can read more about using Symfony with Platform.sh on the
official `Platform.sh documentation`_.

Deploy an Existing Site
-----------------------

In this guide, it is assumed your codebase is already versioned with Git.

Get a Project on Platform.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to subscribe to a `Platform.sh project`_. Choose the development plan
and go through the checkout process. Once your project is ready, give it a name
and choose: **Import an existing site**.

Prepare Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To deploy your Symfony application on Platform.sh, you simply need to add a
``.platform.app.yaml`` at the root of your Git repository which will tell
Platform.sh how to deploy your application (read more about
`Platform.sh configuration files`_).

.. code-block:: yaml

    # .platform.app.yaml

    # This file describes an application. You can have multiple applications
    # in the same project.

    # The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
    name: myphpproject

    # The toolstack used to build the application.
    toolstack: "php:symfony"

    # The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
    # The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
    # to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
    # side is in the form `<service name>:<endpoint name>`.
    relationships:
        database: "mysql:mysql"

    # The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
    web:
        # The public directory of the app, relative to its root.
        document_root: "/web"
        # The front-controller script to send non-static requests to.
        passthru: "/app.php"

    # The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
    disk: 2048

    # The mounts that will be performed when the package is deployed.
    mounts:
        "/app/cache": "shared:files/cache"
        "/app/logs": "shared:files/logs"

    # The hooks that will be performed when the package is deployed.
    hooks:
        build: |
          rm web/app_dev.php
          app/console --env=prod assetic:dump --no-debug
        deploy: |
          app/console --env=prod cache:clear

For best practices, you should also add a ``.platform`` folder at the root of
your Git repository which contains the following files:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # .platform/routes.yaml
    "http://{default}/":
        type: upstream
        upstream: "php:php"

.. code-block:: yaml

    # .platform/services.yaml
    mysql:
        type: mysql
        disk: 2048

An example of these configurations can be found on `GitHub`_. The list of
`available services <configure-services>`_ can be found on the Platform.sh documentation.

Configure Database Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Platform.sh overrides your database specific configuration via importing the
following file::

    // app/config/parameters_platform.php
    <?php
    $relationships = getenv("PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS");
        if (!$relationships) {
            return;
    }

    $relationships = json_decode(base64_decode($relationships), true);

    foreach ($relationships['database'] as $endpoint) {
        if (empty($endpoint['query']['is_master'])) {
          continue;
        }

        $container->setParameter('database_driver', 'pdo_' . $endpoint['scheme']);
        $container->setParameter('database_host', $endpoint['host']);
        $container->setParameter('database_port', $endpoint['port']);
        $container->setParameter('database_name', $endpoint['path']);
        $container->setParameter('database_user', $endpoint['username']);
        $container->setParameter('database_password', $endpoint['password']);
        $container->setParameter('database_path', '');
    }

    # Store session into /tmp.
    ini_set('session.save_path', '/tmp/sessions');

Make sure this file is listed in your *imports*:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    imports:
        - { resource: parameters_platform.php }

Deploy your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you need to add a remote to Platform.sh in your Git repository (copy the
command that you see on the Platform.sh web UI):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git remote add platform [PROJECT-ID]@git.[CLUSTER].platform.sh:[PROJECT-ID].git

``PROJECT-ID``
    Unique identifier of your project. Something like ``kjh43kbobssae``
``CLUSTER``
    Server location where your project is deployed. It can be ``eu`` or ``us``

Commit the Platform.sh specific files created in the previous section:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git add .platform.app.yaml .platform/*
    $ git add app/config/config.yml app/config/parameters_platform.php
    $ git commit -m "Adding Platform.sh configuration files."

Push your code base to the newly added remote:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git push platform master

That's it! Your application is being deployed on Platform.sh and you'll soon be
able to access it in your browser.

Every code change that you do from now on will be pushed to Git in order to
redeploy your environment on Platform.sh.

More information about `migrating your database and files <migrate-existing-site>`_ can be found on the
Platform.sh documentation.

Deploy a new Site
-----------------

You can start a new `Platform.sh project`_. Choose the development plan and go
through the checkout process.

Once your project is ready, give it a name and choose: **Create a new site**.
Choose the *Symfony* stack and a starting point such as *Standard*.

That's it! Your Symfony application will be bootstrapped and deployed. You'll
soon be able to see it in your browser.
