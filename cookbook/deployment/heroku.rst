   single: Deployment; Deploying to Heroku Cloud

Deploying to Heroku Cloud
=========================

This step by step cookbook describes how to deploy a Symfony web application to
the Heroku cloud platform. Its contents are based on `the original article`_
published by Heroku.

Setting up
----------

To setup a new Heroku website, first `signup with Heroku`_ or sign in
with your credentials. Then download and install the `Heroku Toolbelt`_ on your
local computer.

You can also check out the `getting Started with PHP on Heroku`_ guide to gain
more familiarity with the specifics of working with PHP applications on Heroku.

Preparing your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying a Symfony application to Heroku doesn't require any change in its
code, but it requires some minor tweaks to its configuration.

By default, the Symfony app will log into your application's ``app/log/``
directory. This is not ideal as Heroku uses an `ephemeral file system`_. On
Heroku, the best way to handle logging is using `Logplex`_. And the best way to
send log data to Logplex is by writing to ``STDERR`` or ``STDOUT``. Luckily,
Symfony uses the excellent Monolog library for logging. So, a new log
destination is just a change to a config file away.

Open the ``app/config/config_prod.yml`` file, locate the
``monolog/handlers/nested``  section (or create it if it doesn't exist yet) and
change the value of ``path`` from
``"%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log"`` to ``"php://stderr"``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config_prod.yml
    monolog:
        # ...
        handlers:
            # ...
            nested:
                # ...
                path: "php://stderr"

Once the application is deployed, run ``heroku logs --tail`` to keep the
stream of logs from Heroku open in your terminal.


Build priority in Composer 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check that you call ``clearCache`` in the end of your app build, otherwise there can be situations
when during the build you will generate hardcored links to heroku ``/tmp`` path. Typical Symfony2 
build steps in ``composer.json`` should look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    "post-install-cmd": [
        "Incenteev\\ParameterHandler\\ScriptHandler::buildParameters",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::buildBootstrap",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installAssets",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installRequirementsFile",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::removeSymfonyStandardFiles",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::clearCache"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "Incenteev\\ParameterHandler\\ScriptHandler::buildParameters",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::buildBootstrap",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installAssets",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installRequirementsFile",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::removeSymfonyStandardFiles",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::clearCache"
    ]

Creating a new Application on Heroku
------------------------------------

To create a new Heroku application that you can push to, use the CLI ``create``
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ heroku create

    Creating mighty-hamlet-1981 in organization heroku... done, stack is cedar
    http://mighty-hamlet-1981.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:mighty-hamlet-1981.git
    Git remote heroku added

You are now ready to deploy the application as explained in the next section.

Deploying your Application on Heroku
------------------------------------

To deploy your application to Heroku, you must first create a ``Procfile``,
which tells Heroku what command to use to launch the web server with the
correct settings. After you've done that, you can simply ``git push`` and
you're done!

Creating a Procfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Heroku will launch an Apache web server together with PHP to serve
applications. However, two special circumstances apply to Symfony applications:

1. The document root is in the ``web/`` directory and not in the root directory
   of the application;
2. The Composer ``bin-dir``, where vendor binaries (and thus Heroku's own boot
   scripts) are placed, is ``bin/`` , and not the default ``vendor/bin``.

.. note::

    Vendor binaries are usually installed to ``vendor/bin`` by Composer, but
    sometimes (e.g. when running a Symfony Standard Edition project!), the
    location will be different. If in doubt, you can always run
    ``composer config bin-dir`` to figure out the right location.

Create a new file called ``Procfile`` (without any extension) at the root
directory of the application and add just the following content:

.. code-block:: text

    web: bin/heroku-php-apache2 web/

If you prefer working on the command console, execute the following commands to
create the ``Procfile`` file and to add it to the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo "web: bin/heroku-php-apache2 web/" > Procfile
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Procfile for Apache and PHP"
    [master 35075db] Procfile for Apache and PHP
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

Configuring Symfony to run in the prod environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you donâ€™t explicitly configure the environment (``dev``, ``prod`` etc)
to use, Symfony will, by default, use the ``dev`` environment in console
commands and at runtime. That would break our build, because in dev environments, 
Symfony uses the ``SensioGeneratorBundle``to perform certain tasks, but that bundle
is not installed upon a push - `Composer does not install dev packages when pushing to Heroku`_.
For Symfony to know it needs to use the ``prod`` environment at all times, it reads
from the ``SYMFONY_ENV`` environment variable. You can simply `set environment variables`_ using
the ``heroku config`` feature, so run this one command as the last step before deploying
your app for the first time:

.. code-block:: bash

    $heroku config:set SYMFONY_ENV=prod
    Setting config vars and restarting mighty-hamlet-1981... done, v3
    SYMFONY_ENV: prod

Pushing to Heroku
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next up, it's finally time to deploy your application to Heroku. If you are
doing this for the very first time, you may see a message such as the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    The authenticity of host 'heroku.com (50.19.85.132)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 8b:48:5e:67:0e:c9:16:47:32:f2:87:0c:1f:c8:60:ad.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

In this case, you need to confirm by typing ``yes`` and hitting ``<Enter>`` key
- ideally after you've `verified that the RSA key fingerprint is correct`_.

Then, deploy your application executing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git push heroku master

    Initializing repository, done.

And that's it! If you now open your browser, either by manually pointing
it to the URL ``heroku create`` gave you, or by using the Heroku Toolbelt, the
application will respond:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ heroku open
    Opening mighty-hamlet-1981... done

You should be seeing your Symfony application in your browser.
