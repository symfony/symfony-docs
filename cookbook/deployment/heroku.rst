   single: Deployment; Deploying to Heroku Cloud

Deploying to Heroku Cloud
=========================

This step by step cookbook describes how to deploy a Symfony web application to
the Heroku cloud platform. Its contents are based on `the original article`_
published by Heroku.

Setting up
----------

To set up a new Heroku website, first `sign up with Heroku`_ or sign in
with your credentials. Then download and install the `Heroku Toolbelt`_ on your
local computer.

You can also check out the `getting Started with PHP on Heroku`_ guide to gain
more familiarity with the specifics of working with PHP applications on Heroku.

Preparing your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying a Symfony application to Heroku doesn't require any change in its
code, but it requires some minor tweaks to its configuration.

By default, the Symfony app will log into your application's ``app/log/``
directory. This is not ideal as Heroku uses an `ephemeral file system`_. On
Heroku, the best way to handle logging is using `Logplex`_. And the best way to
send log data to Logplex is by writing to ``STDERR`` or ``STDOUT``. Luckily,
Symfony uses the excellent Monolog library for logging. So, a new log
destination is just a change to a config file away.

Open the ``app/config/config_prod.yml`` file, locate the
``monolog/handlers/nested``  section (or create it if it doesn't exist yet) and
change the value of ``path`` from
``"%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log"`` to ``"php://stderr"``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config_prod.yml
    monolog:
        # ...
        handlers:
            # ...
            nested:
                # ...
                path: 'php://stderr'

Once the application is deployed, run ``heroku logs --tail`` to keep the
stream of logs from Heroku open in your terminal.

Creating a new Application on Heroku
------------------------------------

To create a new Heroku application that you can push to, use the CLI ``create``
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ heroku create

    Creating mighty-hamlet-1981 in organization heroku... done, stack is cedar
    http://mighty-hamlet-1981.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:mighty-hamlet-1981.git
    Git remote heroku added

You are now ready to deploy the application as explained in the next section.

Deploying your Application on Heroku
------------------------------------

Before your first deploy, you need to do just three more things, which are explained
below:

#. :ref:`Create a Procfile <heroku-procfile>`

#. :ref:`Set the Environment to prod <heroku-setting-env-to-prod>`

#. :ref:`Push your Code to Heroku <heroku-push-code>`

.. _heroku-procfile:
.. _creating-a-procfile:

1) Create a Procfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Heroku will launch an Apache web server together with PHP to serve
applications. However, two special circumstances apply to Symfony applications:

#. The document root is in the ``web/`` directory and not in the root directory
   of the application;
#. The Composer ``bin-dir``, where vendor binaries (and thus Heroku's own boot
   scripts) are placed, is ``bin/`` , and not the default ``vendor/bin``.

.. note::

    Vendor binaries are usually installed to ``vendor/bin`` by Composer, but
    sometimes (e.g. when running a Symfony Standard Edition project!), the
    location will be different. If in doubt, you can always run
    ``composer config bin-dir`` to figure out the right location.

Create a new file called ``Procfile`` (without any extension) at the root
directory of the application and add just the following content:

.. code-block:: text

    web: bin/heroku-php-apache2 web/

.. note::

    If you prefer to use Nginx, which is also available on Heroku, you can create
    a configuration file for it and point to it from your Procfile as described
    in the `Heroku documentation`_:

    .. code-block:: text

        web: bin/heroku-php-nginx -C nginx_app.conf web/

If you prefer working on the command console, execute the following commands to
create the ``Procfile`` file and to add it to the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo "web: bin/heroku-php-apache2 web/" > Procfile
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Procfile for Apache and PHP"
    [master 35075db] Procfile for Apache and PHP
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

.. _heroku-setting-env-to-prod:
.. _setting-the-prod-environment:

2) Set the Environment to prod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During a deployment, Heroku runs ``composer install --no-dev`` to install all the
dependencies your application requires. However, typical `post-install-commands`_
in ``composer.json``, e.g. to install assets or clear (or pre-warm) caches, run
using Symfony's ``dev`` environment by default.

This is clearly not what you want - the app runs in "production" (even if you
use it just for an experiment, or as a staging environment), and so any build
steps should use the same ``prod`` environment as well.

Thankfully, the solution to this problem is very simple: Symfony will pick up an
environment variable named ``SYMFONY_ENV`` and use that environment if nothing
else is explicitly set. As Heroku exposes all `config vars`_ as environment
variables, you can issue a single command to prepare your app for a deployment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ heroku config:set SYMFONY_ENV=prod

.. caution::

    Be aware that dependencies from ``composer.json`` listed in the ``require-dev``
    section are never installed during a deploy on Heroku. This may cause problems
    if your Symfony environment relies on such packages. The solution is to move these
    packages from ``require-dev`` to the ``require`` section.

.. _heroku-push-code:
.. _pushing-to-heroku:

3) Push your Code to Heroku
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next up, it's finally time to deploy your application to Heroku. If you are
doing this for the very first time, you may see a message such as the following:

.. code-block:: text

    The authenticity of host 'heroku.com (50.19.85.132)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 8b:48:5e:67:0e:c9:16:47:32:f2:87:0c:1f:c8:60:ad.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

In this case, you need to confirm by typing ``yes`` and hitting ``<Enter>`` key
- ideally after you've `verified that the RSA key fingerprint is correct`_.

Then, deploy your application executing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git push heroku master

    To git@heroku.com:mighty-hamlet-1981.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master

And that's it! If you now open your browser, either by manually pointing
it to the URL ``heroku create`` gave you, or by using the Heroku Toolbelt, the
application will respond:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ heroku open
    Opening mighty-hamlet-1981... done

You should be seeing your Symfony application in your browser.

.. caution::

    If you take your first steps on Heroku using a fresh installation of
    the Symfony Standard Edition, you may run into a 404 page not found error.
    This is because the route for ``/`` is defined by the AcmeDemoBundle, but the
    AcmeDemoBundle is only loaded in the dev environment (check out your
    ``AppKernel`` class). Try opening ``/app/example`` from the AppBundle.

Custom Compile Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to execute additional custom commands during a build, you can leverage
Heroku's `custom compile steps`_. Imagine you want to remove the ``dev`` front controller
from your production environment on Heroku in order to avoid a potential vulnerability.
Adding a command to remove ``web/app_dev.php`` to Composer's `post-install-commands`_ would
work, but it also removes the controller in your local development environment on each
``composer install`` or ``composer update`` respectively. Instead, you can add a
`custom Composer command`_ named ``compile`` (this key name is a Heroku convention) to the
``scripts`` section of your ``composer.json``. The listed commands hook into Heroku's deploy
process:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "scripts": {
            "compile": [
                "rm web/app_dev.php"
            ]
        }
    }

This is also very useful to build assets on the production system, e.g. with Assetic:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "scripts": {
            "compile": [
                "bin/console assetic:dump"
            ]
        }
    }

.. sidebar:: Node.js Dependencies

    Building assets may depend on node packages, e.g. ``uglifyjs`` or ``uglifycss``
    for asset minification. Installing node packages during the deploy requires a node
    installation. But currently, Heroku compiles your app using the PHP buildpack, which
    is auto-detected by the presence of a ``composer.json`` file, and does not include a
    node installation. Because the Node.js buildpack has a higher precedence than the PHP
    buildpack (see `Heroku buildpacks`_), adding a ``package.json`` listing your node
    dependencies makes Heroku opt for the Node.js buildpack instead:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "name": "myApp",
            "engines": {
                "node": "0.12.x"
            },
            "dependencies": {
                "uglifycss": "*",
                "uglify-js": "*"
            }
        }

    With the next deploy, Heroku compiles your app using the Node.js buildpack and
    your npm packages become installed. On the other hand, your ``composer.json`` is
    now ignored. To compile your app with both buildpacks, Node.js *and* PHP, you need
    to use both buildpacks. To override buildpack auto-detection, you
    need to explicitly set the buildpack:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
        Buildpack set. Next release on your-application will use heroku/nodejs.
        Run git push heroku master to create a new release using this buildpack.
        $ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/php --index 2
        Buildpack set. Next release on your-application will use:
          1. heroku/nodejs
          2. heroku/php
        Run git push heroku master to create a new release using these buildpacks.

    With the next deploy, you can benefit from both buildpacks. This setup also enables
    your Heroku environment to make use of node based automatic build tools like
    `Grunt`_ or `gulp`_.
