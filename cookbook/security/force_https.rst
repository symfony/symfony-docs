How to Force HTTPS or HTTP for different URLs
=============================================

You can force areas of your site to use the HTTPS protocol in the security
config. This is done through the ``access_control`` rules using the ``requires_channel``
option. For example, if you want to force all URLs starting with ``/secure``
to use HTTPS then you could use the following configuration:

.. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: yaml

            access_control:
                - { path: ^/secure, roles: ROLE_ADMIN, requires_channel: https }

        .. code-block:: xml

            <access-control>
                <rule path="^/secure" role="ROLE_ADMIN" requires_channel="https" />
            </access-control>

        .. code-block:: php

            'access_control' => array(
                array(
                    'path'             => '^/secure',
                    'role'             => 'ROLE_ADMIN',
                    'requires_channel' => 'https',
                ),
            ),

The login form itself needs to allow anonymous access, otherwise users will
be unable to authenticate. To force it to use HTTPS you can still use
``access_control`` rules by using the ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY``
role:

.. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: yaml

            access_control:
                - { path: ^/login, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY, requires_channel: https }

        .. code-block:: xml

            <access-control>
                <rule path="^/login"
                      role="IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY"
                      requires_channel="https" />
            </access-control>

        .. code-block:: php

            'access_control' => array(
                array(
                    'path'             => '^/login',
                    'role'             => 'IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY',
                    'requires_channel' => 'https',
                ),
            ),

It is also possible to specify using HTTPS in the routing configuration,
see :doc:`/cookbook/routing/scheme` for more details.
