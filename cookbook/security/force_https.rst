How to force HTTPS or HTTP for Different URLs
=============================================

This article has not been written yet, but will soon. If you're interested
in writing this entry, see :doc:`/contributing/documentation/overview`.

This topic is meant to show how access controls can be used to force HTTPS
or HTTP. Of course, the functionality also exists via routes, so a good example
showing how both can work should be used. Also, it should be shown how you
can force HTTPS for your login page by creating an access control requiring
only the ``IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY`` role.
