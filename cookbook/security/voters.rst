How to Implement your own Voter to Blacklist IP Addresses
=========================================================

The Symfony Security component provides several layers to authorize users.
One of the layers is called a "voter". A voter is a dedicated class that checks
if the user has the rights to connect to the application or access a specific
resource/URL. For instance, Symfony provides a layer that checks if the user
is fully authorized or if it has some expected roles.

It is sometimes useful to create a custom voter to handle a specific case not
handled by the framework. In this section, you'll learn how to create a voter
that will allow you to blacklist users by their IP.

The Voter Interface
-------------------

A custom voter must implement
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Authorization\\Voter\\VoterInterface`,
which requires the following three methods:

.. include:: /cookbook/security/voter_interface.rst.inc

In this example, you'll check if the user's IP address matches against a list of
blacklisted addresses and "something" will be the application. If the user's IP is blacklisted, you'll return
``VoterInterface::ACCESS_DENIED``, otherwise you'll return
``VoterInterface::ACCESS_ABSTAIN`` as this voter's purpose is only to deny
access, not to grant access.

Creating a custom Voter
-----------------------

To blacklist a user based on its IP, you can use the ``request_stack`` service
and compare the IP address against a set of blacklisted IP addresses:

.. code-block:: php

    // src/AppBundle/Security/Authorization/Voter/ClientIpVoter.php
    namespace AppBundle\Security\Authorization\Voter;

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RequestStack;
    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\Voter\VoterInterface;
    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authentication\Token\TokenInterface;

    class ClientIpVoter implements VoterInterface
    {
        protected $requestStack;
        private $blacklistedIp;

        public function __construct(RequestStack $requestStack, array $blacklistedIp = array())
        {
            $this->requestStack  = $requestStack;
            $this->blacklistedIp = $blacklistedIp;
        }

        public function supportsAttribute($attribute)
        {
            // you won't check against a user attribute, so return true
            return true;
        }

        public function supportsClass($class)
        {
            // your voter supports all type of token classes, so return true
            return true;
        }

        public function vote(TokenInterface $token, $object, array $attributes)
        {
            $request = $this->requestStack->getCurrentRequest();
            if (in_array($request->getClientIp(), $this->blacklistedIp)) {
                return VoterInterface::ACCESS_DENIED;
            }

            return VoterInterface::ACCESS_ABSTAIN;
        }
    }

That's it! The voter is done. The next step is to inject the voter into
the security layer. This can be done easily through the service container.

.. tip::

    Your implementation of the methods
    :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Authorization\\Voter\\VoterInterface::supportsAttribute`
    and :method:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Authorization\\Voter\\VoterInterface::supportsClass`
    are not being called internally by the framework. Once you have registered your
    voter the ``vote()`` method will always be called, regardless of whether
    or not these two methods return true. Therefore you need to call those
    methods in your implementation of the ``vote()`` method and return ``ACCESS_ABSTAIN``
    if your voter does not support the class or attribute.

Declaring the Voter as a Service
--------------------------------

To inject the voter into the security layer, you must declare it as a service,
and tag it as a ``security.voter``:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # src/Acme/AcmeBundle/Resources/config/services.yml
        services:
            security.access.blacklist_voter:
                class:     AppBundle\Security\Authorization\Voter\ClientIpVoter
                arguments: ["@request_stack", [123.123.123.123, 171.171.171.171]]
                public:    false
                tags:
                    - { name: security.voter }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- src/Acme/AcmeBundle/Resources/config/services.xml -->
        <service id="security.access.blacklist_voter"
                 class="AppBundle\Security\Authorization\Voter\ClientIpVoter" public="false">
            <argument type="service" id="request_stack" strict="false" />
            <argument type="collection">
                <argument>123.123.123.123</argument>
                <argument>171.171.171.171</argument>
            </argument>
            <tag name="security.voter" />
        </service>

    .. code-block:: php

        // src/Acme/AcmeBundle/Resources/config/services.php
        use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Definition;
        use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Reference;

        $definition = new Definition(
            'AppBundle\Security\Authorization\Voter\ClientIpVoter',
            array(
                new Reference('request_stack'),
                array('123.123.123.123', '171.171.171.171'),
            ),
        );
        $definition->addTag('security.voter');
        $definition->setPublic(false);

        $container->setDefinition('security.access.blacklist_voter', $definition);

.. tip::

   Be sure to import this configuration file from your main application
   configuration file (e.g. ``app/config/config.yml``). For more information
   see :ref:`service-container-imports-directive`. To read more about defining
   services in general, see the :doc:`/book/service_container` chapter.

.. _security-voters-change-strategy:

Changing the Access Decision Strategy
-------------------------------------

In order for the new voter to take effect, you need to change the default access
decision strategy, which, by default, grants access if *any* voter grants
access.

In this case, choose the ``unanimous`` strategy. Unlike the ``affirmative``
strategy (the default), with the ``unanimous`` strategy, if only one voter
denies access (e.g. the ``ClientIpVoter``), access is not granted to the
end user.

To do that, override the default ``access_decision_manager`` section of your
application configuration file with the following code.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            access_decision_manager:
                # strategy can be: affirmative, unanimous or consensus
                strategy: unanimous

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <!-- strategy can be: affirmative, unanimous or consensus -->
            <access-decision-manager strategy="unanimous">
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.xml
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            // strategy can be: affirmative, unanimous or consensus
            'access_decision_manager' => array(
                'strategy' => 'unanimous',
            ),
        ));

That's it! Now, when deciding whether or not a user should have access,
the new voter will deny access to any user in the list of blacklisted IPs.

Note that the voters are only called, if any access is actually checked. So 
you need at least something like 

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            access_control:
                - { path: ^/, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <config>
            <access-control>
               <rule path="^/" role="IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY" />
            </access-control>
        </config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.xml
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'access_control' => array(
               array('path' => '^/', 'role' => 'IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY'),
            ),
         ));
