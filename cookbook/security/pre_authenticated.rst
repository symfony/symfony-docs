Using pre Authenticated Security Firewalls
==========================================

A lot of authentication modules are already provided by some web servers,
including Apache. These modules generally set some environment variables
that can be used to determine which user is accessing your application. Out of the
box, Symfony supports most authentication mechanisms.
These requests are called *pre authenticated* requests because the user is already
authenticated when reaching your application.

X.509 Client Certificate Authentication
---------------------------------------

When using client certificates, your webserver is doing all the authentication
process itself. With Apache, for example, you would use the
``SSLVerifyClient Require`` directive.

Enable the x509 authentication for a particular firewall in the security configuration:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                secured_area:
                    pattern: ^/
                    x509:
                        provider: your_user_provider

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" ?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services">

            <config>
                <firewall name="secured_area" pattern="^/">
                    <x509 provider="your_user_provider"/>
                </firewall>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'firewalls' => array(
                'secured_area' => array(
                    'pattern' => '^/'
                    'x509'    => array(
                        'provider' => 'your_user_provider',
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ));

By default, the firewall provides the ``SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_Email`` variable to
the user provider, and sets the ``SSL_CLIENT_S_DN`` as credentials in the
:class:`Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\Authentication\\Token\\PreAuthenticatedToken`.
You can override these by setting the ``user`` and the ``credentials`` keys
in the x509 firewall configuration respectively.

.. _cookbook-security-pre-authenticated-user-provider-note:

.. note::

    An authentication provider will only inform the user provider of the username
    that made the request. You will need to create (or use) a "user provider" that
    is referenced by the ``provider`` configuration parameter (``your_user_provider``
    in the configuration example). This provider will turn the username into a User
    object of your choice. For more information on creating or configuring a user
    provider, see:

    * :doc:`/cookbook/security/custom_provider`
    * :doc:`/cookbook/security/entity_provider`

REMOTE_USER Based Authentication
--------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.6
    REMOTE_USER pre authenticated firewall was introduced in Symfony 2.6.

A lot of authentication modules, like ``auth_kerb`` for Apache provide the username
using the ``REMOTE_USER`` environment variable. This variable can be trusted by
the application since the authentication happened before the request reached it.

To configure Symfony using the ``REMOTE_USER`` environment variable, simply enable the
corresponding firewall in your security configuration:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/security.yml
        security:
            firewalls:
                secured_area:
                    pattern: ^/
                    remote_user:
                        provider: your_user_provider

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/security.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" ?>
        <srv:container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/security"
            xmlns:srv="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services">

            <config>
                <firewall name="secured_area" pattern="^/">
                    <remote-user provider="your_user_provider"/>
                </firewall>
            </config>
        </srv:container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/security.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('security', array(
            'firewalls' => array(
                'secured_area' => array(
                    'pattern'     => '^/'
                    'remote_user' => array(
                        'provider' => 'your_user_provider',
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ));

The firewall will then provide the ``REMOTE_USER`` environment variable to
your user provider. You can change the variable name used by setting the ``user``
key in the ``remote_user`` firewall configuration.

.. note::

    Just like for X509 authentication, you will need to configure a "user provider".
    See :ref:`the note previous note <cookbook-security-pre-authenticated-user-provider-note>`
    for more information.
