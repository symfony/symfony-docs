==================================================================

This article has not been written yet, but will soon. If you're interested
in writing this entry, see :doc:`/contributing/documentation/overview`.

This topic is meant to be a full working example of how to use the ``entity``
user provider with the security component. It should show how to create the
``User`` class, implement the methods, mapping, etc - everything you'll need
to get a fully-functionality entity user provider working.
