How to create a custom User Provider
====================================

This article has not been written yet, but will soon. If you're interested
in writing this entry, see :doc:`/contributing/documentation/overview`.

This topic is meant to show how a custom user provider can be created. One
potential example - though a better example is welcomed - is to show how
a custom ``User`` class can be created and then populated via a custom user
provider that loads users by making an API service call out to some external
site.
