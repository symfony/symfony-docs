How to secure any Service or Method in your Application
=======================================================

This article has not been written yet, but will soon. If you're interested
in writing this entry, see :doc:`/contributing/documentation/overview`.

This entry should show how you can inject the security context into any service
and then protect anything you want. This will likely reference parts from
the service container document and should also tease the SecurityExtraBundle.
Ideally, it should be a somewhat real example that shows the whole process,
including creating the service in the service container configuration.
