How to Use Assetic for Asset Management
=======================================

Assetic combines two major ideas: assets and filters. The assets are files
such as CSS, JavaScript and image files. The filters are things that can
be applied to these files before they are served to the browser. This allows
a separation between the asset files stored in the application and the files
actually presented to the user.

Without Assetic, you just serve the files that are stored in the application
directly:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        <script src="{{ asset('js/script.js') }}" type="text/javascript" />

    .. code-block:: php

        <script src="<?php echo $view['assets']->getUrl('js/script.js') ?>"
                type="text/javascript" />

But *with* Assetic, you can manipulate these assets however you want (or
load them from anywhere) before serving them. These means you can:

* Minify and combine all of your CSS and JS files

* Run all (or just some) of your CSS or JS files through some sort of compiler,
  such as LESS, SASS or CoffeeScript

* Run image optimizations on your images

Assets
------

Using Assetic provides many advantages over directly serving the files.
The files do not need to be stored where they are served from and can be
drawn from various sources such as from within a bundle:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% javascripts
            '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'
        %}
        <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
        {% endjavascripts %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->javascripts(
            array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*')) as $url): ?>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>"></script>
        <?php endforeach; ?>

.. tip::

    To bring in CSS stylesheets, you can use the same methodologies seen
    in this entry, except with the `stylesheets` tag:

    .. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: html+jinja

            {% stylesheets
                '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/css/*'
            %}
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset_url }}" />
            {% endstylesheets %}

        .. code-block:: html+php

            <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->stylesheets(
                array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/css/*')) as $url): ?>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>" />
            <?php endforeach; ?>

In this example, all of the files in the ``Resources/public/js/`` directory
of the ``AcmeFooBundle`` will be loaded and served from a different location.
The actual rendered tag might simply look like:

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="/app_dev.php/js/abcd123.js"></script>

.. note::

    This is a key point: once you let Assetic handle your assets, the files are
    served from a different location. This *can* cause problems with CSS files
    that reference images by their relative path. However, this can be fixed
    by using the ``cssrewrite`` filter, which updates paths in CSS files
    to reflect their new location.

Combining Assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also combine several files into one. This helps to reduce the number
of HTTP requests, which is great for front end performance. It also allows
you to maintain the files more easily by splitting them into manageable parts.
This can help with re-usability as you can easily split project-specific
files from those which can be used in other applications, but still serve
them as a single file:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% javascripts
            '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'
            '@AcmeBarBundle/Resources/public/js/form.js'
            '@AcmeBarBundle/Resources/public/js/calendar.js'
        %}
        <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
        {% endjavascripts %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->javascripts(
            array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*',
                  '@AcmeBarBundle/Resources/public/js/form.js',
                  '@AcmeBarBundle/Resources/public/js/calendar.js')) as $url): ?>
        <script src="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>"></script>
        <?php endforeach; ?>

In the `dev` environment, each file is still served individually, so that
you can debug problems more easily. However, in the `prod` environment, this
will be rendered as a single `script` tag.

.. tip::

    If you're new to Assetic and try to use your application in the ``prod``
    environment (by using the ``app.php`` controller), you'll likely see
    that all of your CSS and JS breaks. Don't worry! This is on purpose.
    For details on using Assetic in the `prod` environment, see :ref:`cookbook-assetic-dumping`.

And combining files doesn't only apply to *your* files. You can also use Assetic to
combine third party assets, such as jQuery, with your own into a single file:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% javascripts
            '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/thirdparty/jquery.js'
            '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'
        %}
        <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
        {% endjavascripts %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->javascripts(
            array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/thirdparty/jquery.js',
                  '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*')) as $url): ?>
        <script src="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>"></script>
        <?php endforeach; ?>

Filters
-------

Once they're managed by Assetic, you can apply filters to your assets before
they are served. This includes filters that compress the output of your assets
for smaller file sizes (and better front-end optimization). Other filters
can compile JavaScript file from CoffeeScript files and process SASS into CSS.
In fact, Assetic has a long list of available filters.

Many of the filters do not do the work directly, but use existing third-party
libraries to do the heavy-lifting. This means that you'll often need to install
a third-party library to use a filter.  The great advantage of using Assetic
to invoke these libraries (as opposed to using them directly) is that instead
of having to run them manually after you work on the files, Assetic will
take care of this for you and remove this step altogether from your development
and deployment processes.

To use a filter, you first need to specify it in the Assetic configuration.
Adding a filter here doesn't mean it's being used - it just means that it's
available to use (we'll use the filter below).

For example to use the JavaScript YUI Compressor the following config should
be added:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        assetic:
            filters:
                yui_js:
                    jar: "%kernel.root_dir%/Resources/java/yuicompressor.jar"

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config.xml -->
        <assetic:config>
            <assetic:filter
                name="yui_js"
                jar="%kernel.root_dir%/Resources/java/yuicompressor.jar" />
        </assetic:config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('assetic', array(
            'filters' => array(
                'yui_js' => array(
                    'jar' => '%kernel.root_dir%/Resources/java/yuicompressor.jar',
                ),
            ),
        ));

Now, to actually *use* the filter on a group of JavaScript files, add it
into your template:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% javascripts
            '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'
            filter='yui_js'
        %}
        <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
        {% endjavascripts %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->javascripts(
            array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'),
            array('yui_js')) as $url): ?>
        <script src="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>"></script>
        <?php endforeach; ?>

A more detailed guide about configuring and using Assetic filters as well as
details of Assetic's debug mode can be found in :doc:`/cookbook/assetic/yuicompressor`.

Controlling the URL used
------------------------

If you wish to you can control the URLs that Assetic produces. This is
done from the template and is relative to the public document root:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% javascripts
            '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'
            output='js/compiled/main.js'
        %}
        <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
        {% endjavascripts %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->javascripts(
            array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'),
            array(),
            array('output' => 'js/compiled/main.js')
        ) as $url): ?>
        <script src="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>"></script>
        <?php endforeach; ?>

.. note::

    Symfony also contains a method for cache *busting*, where the final URL
    generated by Assetic contains a query parameter that can be incremented
    via configuration on each deployment. For more information, see the
    :ref:`ref-framework-assets-version` configuration option.

Dumping Asset Files
-------------------

In the ``dev`` environment, Assetic generates paths to CSS and JavaScript
files that don't physically exist on your computer. But they render nonetheless
because an internal Symfony controller opens the files and serves back the
content (after running any filters).

This kind of dynamic serving of processed assets is great because it means
that you can immediately see the new state of any asset files you change.
It's also bad, because it can be quite slow. If you're using a lot of filters,
it might be downright frustrating.

Fortunately, Assetic provides a way to dump your assets to real files, instead
of being generated dynamically.

Dumping Asset Files in the ``prod`` environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``prod`` environment, your JS and CSS files are represented by a single
tag each. In other words, instead of seeing each JavaScript file you're including
in your source, you'll likely just see something like this:

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="/app_dev.php/js/abcd123.js"></script>

Moreover, that file does **not** actually exist, nor is it dynamically rendered
by Symfony (as the asset files are in the ``dev`` environment). This is on
purpose - letting Symfony generate these files dynamically in a production
environment is just too slow.

Instead, each time you use your app in the ``prod`` environment (and therefore,
each time you deploy), you should run the following task:

.. code-block:: bash

    php app/console assetic:dump --env=prod --no-debug

This will physically generate and write each file that you need (e.g. ``/js/abcd123.js``).
If you update any of your assets, you'll need to run this again to regenerate
the file.

Dumping Asset Files in the ``dev`` environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, each asset path generated in the ``dev`` environment is handled
dynamically by Symfony. This has no disadvantage (you can see your changes
immediately), except that assets can load noticeably slow. If you feel like
your assets are loading too slowly, follow this guide.

First, tell Symfony to stop trying to process these files dynamically. Make
the following change in your ``config_dev.yml`` file:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config_dev.yml
        assetic:
            use_controller: false

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config_dev.xml -->
        <assetic:config use-controller="false" />

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config_dev.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('assetic', array(
            'use_controller' => false,
        ));

Next, since Symfony is no longer generating these assets for you, you'll
need to dump them manually. To do so, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    php app/console assetic:dump

This physically writes all of the asset files you need for your ``dev``
environment. The big disadvantage is that you need to run this each time
you update an asset. Fortunately, by passing the ``--watch`` option, the
command will automatically regenerate assets *as they change*:

.. code-block:: bash

    php app/console assetic:dump --watch

Since running this command in the ``dev`` environment may generate a bunch
of files, it's usually a good idea to point your generated assets files to
some isolated directory (e.g. ``/js/compiled``), to keep things organized:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% javascripts
            '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'
            output='js/compiled/main.js'
        %}
        <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
        {% endjavascripts %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->javascripts(
            array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'),
            array(),
            array('output' => 'js/compiled/main.js')
        ) as $url): ?>
        <script src="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>"></script>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
