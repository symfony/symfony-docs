How to Minify CSS/JS Files (Using UglifyJS and UglifyCSS)
=========================================================

`UglifyJS`_ is a JavaScript parser/compressor/beautifier toolkit. It can be used
to combine and minify JavaScript assets so that they require less HTTP requests
and make your site load faster. `UglifyCSS`_ is a CSS compressor/beautifier
that is very similar to UglifyJS.

In this cookbook, the installation, configuration and usage of UglifyJS is
shown in detail. UglifyCSS works pretty much the same way and is only
talked about briefly.

Install UglifyJS
----------------

UglifyJS is available as an `Node.js`_ npm module and can be installed using
npm. First, you need to `install Node.js`_. Afterwards you can install UglifyJS
using npm:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install -g uglify-js

This command will install UglifyJS globally and you may need to run it as
a root user.

.. note::

    It's also possible to install UglifyJS inside your project only. To do
    this, install it without the ``-g`` option and specify the path where
    to put the module:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cd /path/to/symfony
        $ mkdir app/Resources/node_modules
        $ npm install uglify-js --prefix app/Resources

    It is recommended that you install UglifyJS in your ``app/Resources`` folder
    and add the ``node_modules`` folder to version control. Alternatively,
    you can create an npm `package.json`_ file and specify your dependencies
    there.

Depending on your installation method, you should either be able to execute
the ``uglifyjs`` executable globally, or execute the physical file that lives
in the ``node_modules`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ uglifyjs --help

    $ ./app/Resources/node_modules/.bin/uglifyjs --help

Configure the ``uglifyjs2`` Filter
----------------------------------

Now we need to configure Symfony to use the ``uglifyjs2`` filter when processing
your JavaScripts:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        assetic:
            node: /usr/bin/nodejs
            filters:
                uglifyjs2:
                    # the path to the uglifyjs executable
                    bin: /usr/local/bin/uglifyjs

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config.xml -->
        <assetic:config>
            <!-- bin: the path to the uglifyjs executable -->
            <assetic:filter
                name="uglifyjs2"
                bin="/usr/local/bin/uglifyjs" />
        </assetic:config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('assetic', array(
            'filters' => array(
                'uglifyjs2' => array(
                    // the path to the uglifyjs executable
                    'bin' => '/usr/local/bin/uglifyjs',
                ),
            ),
        ));

.. note::

    The path where UglifyJS is installed may vary depending on your system.
    To find out where npm stores the ``bin`` folder, you can use the following
    command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ npm bin -g

    It should output a folder on your system, inside which you should find
    the UglifyJS executable.

    If you installed UglifyJS locally, you can find the ``bin`` folder inside
    the ``node_modules`` folder. It's called ``.bin`` in this case.

You now have access to the ``uglifyjs2`` filter in your application.

Minify your Assets
------------------

In order to use UglifyJS on your assets, you need to apply it to them. Since
your assets are a part of the view layer, this work is done in your templates:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% javascripts '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*' filter='uglifyjs2' %}
            <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
        {% endjavascripts %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->javascripts(
            array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'),
            array('uglifyj2s')
        ) as $url): ?>
            <script src="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>"></script>
        <?php endforeach; ?>

.. note::

    The above example assumes that you have a bundle called ``AcmeFooBundle``
    and your JavaScript files are in the ``Resources/public/js`` directory under
    your bundle. This isn't important however - you can include your JavaScript
    files no matter where they are.

With the addition of the ``uglifyjs2`` filter to the asset tags above, you
should now see minified JavaScripts coming over the wire much faster.

Disable Minification in Debug Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minified JavaScripts are very difficult to read, let alone debug. Because of
this, Assetic lets you disable a certain filter when your application is in
debug (e.g. ``app_dev.php``) mode. You can do this by prefixing the filter name
in your template with a question mark: ``?``. This tells Assetic to only
apply this filter when debug mode is off (e.g. ``app.php``):

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% javascripts '@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*' filter='?uglifyjs2' %}
            <script src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
        {% endjavascripts %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->javascripts(
            array('@AcmeFooBundle/Resources/public/js/*'),
            array('?uglifyjs2')
        ) as $url): ?>
            <script src="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>"></script>
        <?php endforeach; ?>

To try this out, switch to your ``prod`` environment (``app.php``). But before
you do, don't forget to :ref:`clear your cache <book-page-creation-prod-cache-clear>`
and :ref:`dump your assetic assets <cookbook-assetic-dump-prod>`.

.. tip::

    Instead of adding the filter to the asset tags, you can also globally
    enable it by adding the ``apply_to`` attribute to the filter configuration, for
    example in the ``uglifyjs2`` filter ``apply_to: "\.js$"``. To only have
    the filter applied in production, add this to the ``config_prod`` file
    rather than the common config file. For details on applying filters by
    file extension, see :ref:`cookbook-assetic-apply-to`.

Install, Configure and Use UglifyCSS
------------------------------------

The usage of UglifyCSS works the same way as UglifyJS. First, make sure
the node package is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install -g uglifycss

Next, add the configuration for this filter:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        assetic:
            filters:
                uglifycss:
                    bin: /usr/local/bin/uglifycss

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- app/config/config.xml -->
        <assetic:config>
            <assetic:filter
                name="uglifycss"
                bin="/usr/local/bin/uglifycss" />
        </assetic:config>

    .. code-block:: php

        // app/config/config.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('assetic', array(
            'filters' => array(
                'uglifycss' => array(
                    'bin' => '/usr/local/bin/uglifycss',
                ),
            ),
        ));

To use the filter for your CSS files, add the filter to the Assetic ``stylesheets``
helper:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: html+jinja

        {% stylesheets 'bundles/AcmeFoo/css/*' filter='uglifycss' filter='cssrewrite' %}
             <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset_url }}" />
        {% endstylesheets %}

    .. code-block:: html+php

        <?php foreach ($view['assetic']->stylesheets(
            array('bundles/AcmeFoo/css/*'),
            array('uglifycss'),
            array('cssrewrite')
        ) as $url): ?>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo $view->escape($url) ?>" />
        <?php endforeach; ?>

Just like with the ``uglifyjs2`` filter, if you prefix the filter name with
``?`` (i.e. ``?uglifycss``), the minification will only happen when you're
not in debug mode.
