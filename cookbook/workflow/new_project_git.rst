How to Create and Store a Symfony Project in Git
================================================

.. tip::

    Though this entry is specifically about Git, the same generic principles
    will apply if you're storing your project in Subversion.

Once you've read through :doc:`/book/page_creation` and become familiar with
using Symfony, you'll no-doubt be ready to start your own project. In this
cookbook article, you'll learn the best way to start a new Symfony project
that's stored using the `Git`_ source control management system.

Initial Project Setup
---------------------

To get started, you'll need to download Symfony and get things running. See
the :doc:`/book/installation` chapter for details.

Once your project is running, just follow these simple steps:

#. Initialize your Git repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

        $ git init

#. Add all of the initial files to Git:

   .. code-block:: bash

        $ git add .

   .. tip::

      As you might have noticed, not all files that were downloaded by Composer in step 1,
      have been staged for commit by Git. Certain files and folders, such as the project's
      dependencies (which are managed by Composer), ``parameters.yml`` (which contains sensitive
      information such as database credentials), log and cache files and dumped assets (which are
      created automatically by your project), should not be committed in Git. To help you prevent
      committing those files and folders by accident, the Standard Distribution comes with a
      file called ``.gitignore``, which contains a list of files and folders that Git should
      ignore.

   .. tip::

      You may also want to create a ``.gitignore`` file that can be used system-wide.
      This allows you to exclude files/folders for all your projects that are created by
      your IDE or operating system. For details, see `GitHub .gitignore`_.

#. Create an initial commit with your started project:

   .. code-block:: bash

        $ git commit -m "Initial commit"

At this point, you have a fully-functional Symfony project that's correctly
committed to Git. You can immediately begin development, committing the new
changes to your Git repository.

You can continue to follow along with the :doc:`/book/page_creation` chapter
to learn more about how to configure and develop inside your application.

.. tip::

    The Symfony Standard Edition comes with some example functionality. To
    remove the sample code, follow the instructions in the
    ":doc:`/cookbook/bundles/remove`" article.

Storing your Project on a remote Server
---------------------------------------

You now have a fully-functional Symfony project stored in Git. However,
in most cases, you'll also want to store your project on a remote server
both for backup purposes, and so that other developers can collaborate on
the project.

The easiest way to store your project on a remote server is via a web-based
hosting service like `GitHub`_ or `Bitbucket`_. Of course, there are more
services out there, you can start your research with a
`comparison of hosting services`_.

Alternatively, you can store your Git repository on any server by creating
a `barebones repository`_ and then pushing to it. One library that helps
manage this is `Gitolite`_.
