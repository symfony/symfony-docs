How to Use PHP's built-in Web Server
====================================

.. versionadded:: 2.6
    The ability to run the server as a background process was introduced
    in Symfony 2.6.

Since PHP 5.4 the CLI SAPI comes with a `built-in web server`_. It can be used
to run your PHP applications locally during development, for testing or for
application demonstrations. This way, you don't have to bother configuring
a full-featured web server such as
:doc:`Apache or Nginx </cookbook/configuration/web_server_configuration>`.

.. caution::

    The built-in web server is meant to be run in a controlled environment.
    It is not designed to be used on public networks.

Starting the Web Server
-----------------------

Running a Symfony application using PHP's built-in web server is as easy as
executing the ``server:start`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console server:start

This starts the web server at ``localhost:8000`` in the background that serves
your Symfony application.

By default, the web server listens on port 8000 on the loopback device. You
can change the socket passing an IP address and a port as a command-line argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console server:run 192.168.0.1:8080

.. note::

    You can use the ``server:status`` command to check if a web server is
    listening on a certain socket:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console server:status

        $ php app/console server:status 192.168.0.1:8080

    The first command shows if your Symfony application will be server through
    ``localhost:8000``, the second one does the same for ``192.168.0.1:8080``.

.. note::

    Before Symfony 2.6, the ``server:run`` command was used to start the built-in
    web server. This command is still available and behaves slightly different.
    Instead of starting the server in the background, it will block the current
    terminal until you terminate it (this is usually done by pressing Ctrl
    and C).

.. sidebar:: Using the built-in Web Server from inside a Virtual Machine

    If you want to use the built-in web server from inside a virtual machine
    and then load the site from a browser on your host machine, you'll need
    to listen on the ``0.0.0.0:8000`` address (i.e. on all IP addresses that
    are assigned to the virtual machine):

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console server:start 0.0.0.0:8000

    .. caution::

        You should **NEVER** listen to all interfaces on a computer that is
        directly accessible from the Internet. The built-in web server is
        not designed to be used on public networks.

Command Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The built-in web server expects a "router" script (read about the "router"
script on `php.net`_) as an argument. Symfony already passes such a router
script when the command is executed in the ``prod`` or in the ``dev`` environment.
Use the ``--router`` option in any other environment or to use another router
script:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console server:start --env=test --router=app/config/router_test.php

If your application's document root differs from the standard directory layout,
you have to pass the correct location using the ``--docroot`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console server:start --docroot=public_html

Stopping the Server
-------------------

When you are finished, you can simply stop the web server using the ``server:stop``
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console server:stop

Like with the start command, if you omit the socket information, Symfony will
stop the web server bound to ``localhost:8000``. Just pass the socket information
when the web server listens to another IP address or to another port:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console server:stop 192.168.0.1:8080
