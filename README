What is Symfony?
----------------

Symfony is a PHP 5.3 full-stack web framework. It is written with speed and
flexibility in mind. It allows developers to built better and easy to maintain
websites with PHP.

Symfony can be used to develop all kind of websites, from your personal blog
to high traffic ones like Dailymotion or Yahoo! Answers.

High Performance
----------------

Built with performance in mind, Symfony 2 is one of the fastest PHP
frameworks. It is up to 3 times faster than symfony 1.4 or Zend Framework 1.10
and consumes half the memory.

Requirements
------------

Symfony is only supported on PHP 5.3.2 and up. To check the compatibility of
your environment with Symfony, you can run the `web/check.php` script, bundled
with this sandbox.

Documentation
-------------

Symfony 2.0 is still in the early stages of development, but the "[Quick Tour][1]"
tutorial can get you started fast.

The "Quick Tour" tutorial barely scratches the surface of Symfony 2.0 but it
gives you a first feeling of the framework. If, like us, you think that
Symfony 2.0 can help speed up your development and take the quality of your
work to the next level, visit the official [Symfony 2 website][2] to learn
about it.
