Thanks @xabbuh I have updated the commit. I have just copied the method reference from https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blame/2.3/reference/configuration/framework.rst#L78 Should I change it too? I also think the sentence is missing the word ``method``. Am I right?

Now that I think of this again, the way it is seems to be better given that you can see instantly to which class the method belongs.

I think the same. Can you add it in both sentences?
