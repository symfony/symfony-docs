What about to add a note block before that about install/enable the Serializer component, to make AMQP transport available?

Some more entries to add to the list :)

1. Now that https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/26945 is merged, examples should be updated to reflect the new `Envelope` usage (`SenderInterface::send(Envelope $envelope)` and receivers's handler (`function (?Envelope $envelope)` instead of `function ($message)`).
1. We can mention the `EnvelopeAwareInterface`, how to write items and how to benefit from it in custom middlewares (+ mention existing items)
1. `middlewares` config entry is renamed `middleware` (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/27177)
1. in the config, message buses names are the full service id you'll use (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/27162)

@ogizanagi could you send a PR for that? Has it's not been merged yet, I'd prefer to move it out of the scope of this PR.

Sure I'll do once this one is merged.
