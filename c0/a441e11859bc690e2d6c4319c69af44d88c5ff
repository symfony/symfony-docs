Moreover, I found out that this documentation page lists form types with their real class names ('SearchType, UrlType') starting from 2.8. In 2.3 we still have list of terms like 'email, search, url'.
I believe we should use one single approach for versions 2.3-2.6 and for versions older than 2.8. I could create another PR if somebody else agrees on it.

I'm sorry, I closed PR by mistake. Reopened.
