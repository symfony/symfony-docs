You documented it right the correct way: Saying what will happen and what is required for it to work

I see no other problems with this PR, except that you need to add a `.. versionadded:: 2.5` box before the headline of the strict option saying "The `strict` option was introduced in Symfony 2.5."

Hi @WouterJ the PR has been merged so I guess this can be merged too. Let me know any issues.
Thanks for the help!
