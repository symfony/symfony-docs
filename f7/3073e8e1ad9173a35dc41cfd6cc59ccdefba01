I think it's better to just have a new cookbook section about PSR-7 and how to use it in your application (instead of creating a new section)

Moved to a cookbook entry.

We also need an entry for the new document in the toctree in `/cookbook/index.rst`.

I have a question : Does Symfony 3.0 http foundation will make use of psr-7 or it will be using the bridge itself ?

I have noticed some issues regarding splitting of the session component from http foundation etc.

Thank you.

@harikt 3.0 will not use psr-7 (so you'd use the bridge like now). We need to protect backwards compatibility - but we are discussing the best (and most responsible way) to move towards psr-7.
