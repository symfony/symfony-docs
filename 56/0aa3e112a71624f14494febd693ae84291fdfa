I don't think it's a real CS fix. We use both quotes throughout the source and docs afaik.

@WouterJ in the code, we use double quotes only when they are necessary to be able to use escape sequences (strings containing ``\n`` most of the time). Otherwise, the rule is to use single quotes everywhere (and PHP-CS-Fixer is fixing it for us in most places)
