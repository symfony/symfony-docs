@javiereguiluz Don't know what you mean exactly.

My motivation for committing this: Right now, the `time` setting is explained nowhere. I basically guessed how to write it ;-) The existence of the setting is mentioned a few paragraphs further down:

> The deduplicated handler simply keeps all the messages for a request and then passes them onto the nested handler in one go, but only if the records are unique over a given period of time (60 seconds by default).

So I figured I could squeeze it right into the first code block. Not ideal, but better than nothing :-)

However, we could certainly create a separate code block for this, maybe something like:
````
monolog:
    handlers:
        deduplicated:
            type:    deduplication
            handler: swift
            time: 10

... and position it right below the cited paragraph.
