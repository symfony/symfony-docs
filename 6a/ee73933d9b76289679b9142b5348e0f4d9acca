Does anyone know how to fix the image issue?

Why does this work for https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/helpers/progressbar.html

The url of the gif in that page is not what I expect it to be (it doesn't mention `components/console`), but it works. Also, when I build the docs locally, it works tooâ€¦

Ah something I did not notice: the gif works on this page: https://symfony.com/doc/4.4/contributing/code/stack_trace.html#stack-traces-in-your-web-browser, but not on 5.1, 5.2, or current. It looks like a deploy issue, maybe?
