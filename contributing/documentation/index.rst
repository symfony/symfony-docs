Contributing Documentation
==========================

These short articles explain everything you need to contribute to the Symfony
documentation:

:doc:`The Contribution Process </contributing/documentation/overview>`
  Explains the steps to follow to contribute fixes and new contents. It's the
  same contribution process followed by most open source projects, so you may
  already know everything that is needed.

:doc:`Documentation Formats </contributing/documentation/format>`
  Explains the technical details of the reStructuredText format that is used to
  write the docs. Skip it if you are already familiar with this format.

:doc:`Documentation Standards </contributing/documentation/standards>`
  Explains how to write docs and code examples to match the style and tone of
  the rest of the existing documentation.

:doc:`License </contributing/documentation/license>`
  Explains the details of the Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license used for the
  Symfony Documentation.
