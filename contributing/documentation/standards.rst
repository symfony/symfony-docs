Documentation Standards
=======================

In order to help the reader as much as possible and to create code examples that
look and feel familiar, you should follow these standards.

Sphinx
------

* The following characters are chosen for different heading levels: level 1
  is ``=``, level 2 ``-``, level 3 ``~``, level 4 ``.`` and level 5 ``"``;
* Each line should break approximately after the first word that crosses the
  72nd character (so most lines end up being 72-78 characters);
* The ``::`` shorthand is *preferred* over ``.. code-block:: php`` to begin a PHP
  code block (read `the Sphinx documentation`_ to see when you should use the
  shorthand);
* Inline hyperlinks are **not** used. Separate the link and their target
  definition, which you add on the bottom of the page;
* Inline markup should be closed on the same line as the open-string;

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    Example
    =======

    When you are working on the docs, you should follow the
    `Symfony Documentation`_ standards.

    Level 2
    -------

    A PHP example would be::

        echo 'Hello World';

    Level 3
    ~~~~~~~

    .. code-block:: php

        echo 'You cannot use the :: shortcut here';

    .. _`Symfony Documentation`: http://symfony.com/doc

Code Examples
-------------

* The code follows the :doc:`Symfony Coding Standards </contributing/code/standards>`
  as well as the `Twig Coding Standards`_;
* To avoid horizontal scrolling on code blocks, we prefer to break a line
  correctly if it crosses the 85th character;
* When you fold one or more lines of code, place ``...`` in a comment at the point
  of the fold. These comments are: ``// ...`` (php), ``# ...`` (yaml/bash), ``{# ... #}``
  (twig), ``<!-- ... -->`` (xml/html), ``; ...`` (ini), ``...`` (text);
* When you fold a part of a line, e.g. a variable value, put ``...`` (without comment)
  at the place of the fold;
* Description of the folded code: (optional)
  If you fold several lines: the description of the fold can be placed after the ``...``
  If you fold only part of a line: the description can be placed before the line;
* If useful to the reader, a PHP code example should start with the namespace
  declaration;
* When referencing classes, be sure to show the ``use`` statements at the
  top of your code block. You don't need to show *all* ``use`` statements
  in every example, just show what is actually being used in the code block;
* If useful, a ``codeblock`` should begin with a comment containing the filename
  of the file in the code block. Don't place a blank line after this comment,
  unless the next line is also a comment;
* You should put a ``$`` in front of every bash line.

Formats
~~~~~~~

Configuration examples should show all supported formats using
:ref:`configuration blocks <docs-configuration-blocks>`. The supported formats
(and their orders) are:

* **Configuration** (including services and routing): YAML, XML, PHP
* **Validation**: YAML, Annotations, XML, PHP
* **Doctrine Mapping**: Annotations, YAML, XML, PHP
* **Translation**: XML, YAML, PHP

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Foo/Bar.php
    namespace Foo;

    use Acme\Demo\Cat;
    // ...

    class Bar
    {
        // ...

        public function foo($bar)
        {
            // set foo with a value of bar
            $foo = ...;

            $cat = new Cat($foo);

            // ... check if $bar has the correct value

            return $cat->baz($bar, ...);
        }
    }

.. caution::

    In YAML you should put a space after ``{`` and before ``}`` (e.g. ``{ _controller: ... }``),
    but this should not be done in Twig (e.g.  ``{'hello' : 'value'}``).

Files and Directories
---------------------

* When referencing directories, always add a trailing slash to avoid confusions
  with regular files (e.g. "execute the ``console`` script located at the ``app/``
  directory").
* When referencing file extensions explicitly, you should include a leading dot
  for every extension (e.g. "XML files use the ``.xml`` extension").
* When you list a Symfony file/directory hierarchy, use ``your-project/`` as the
  top level directory. E.g.

  .. code-block:: text

      your-project/
      ├─ app/
      ├─ src/
      ├─ vendor/
      └─ ...

English Language Standards
--------------------------

* **English Dialect**: use the United States English dialect, commonly called
  `American English`_.
* **Section titles**: use a variant of the title case, where the first
  word is always capitalized and all other words are capitalized, except for
  the closed-class words (read Wikipedia article about `headings and titles`_).

  E.g.: The Vitamins are in my Fresh California Raisins

* **Punctuation**: avoid the use of `Serial (Oxford) Commas`_;
* **Pronouns**: avoid the use of `nosism`_ and always use *you* instead of *we*.
  (i.e. avoid the first person point of view: use the second instead);
* **Gender-neutral language**: when referencing a hypothetical person, such as
  *"a user with a session cookie"*, use gender-neutral pronouns (they/their/them).
  For example, instead of:
  * he or she, use they
  * him or her, use them
  * his or her, use their
  * his or hers, use theirs
  * himself or herself, use themselves
