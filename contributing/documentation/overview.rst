Contributing to the Documentation
=================================

One of the essential principles of the Symfony project is that **documentation is
as important as code**. That's why a great amount of resources are dedicated to
documenting new features and to keeping the rest of the documentation up-to-date.

More than 700 developers all around the world have contributed to Symfony's
documentation and we are glad that you are considering joining this big family.
This guide will explain everything you need to contribute to the Symfony
documentation.

Before Your First Contribution
------------------------------

**Before contributing**, you should consider the following:

* Symfony documentation is written using reStructuredText_ markup language.
  If you are not familiar with this format, read :doc:`this article </contributing/documentation/format>`
  for a quick overview of its basic features.
* Symfony documentation is hosted on GitHub_. You'll need a GitHub user account
  to contribute to the documentation.
* Symfony documentation is published under a
  :doc:`Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 License </contributing/documentation/license>`
  and all your contributions will implicitly adhere to that license.

Your First Documentation Contribution
-------------------------------------

In this section, you'll learn how to contribute to the Symfony documentation for
the first time. The next section will explain the shorter process you'll follow
in the future for every contribution after your first one.

Let's imagine that you want to improve the installation chapter of the Symfony
book. In order to make your changes, follow these steps:

**Step 1.** Go to the official Symfony documentation repository located at
`github.com/symfony/symfony-docs`_ and `fork the repository`_ to your personal
account. This is only needed the first time you contribute to Symfony.

**Step 2.** **Clone** the forked repository to your local machine (this
example uses the ``projects/symfony-docs/`` directory to store the documentation;
change this value accordingly):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd projects/
    $ git clone git://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/symfony-docs.git

**Step 3.** Switch to the **oldest maintained branch** before making any change.
Nowadays this is the ``2.3`` branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd symfony-docs/
    $ git checkout 2.3

If you are instead documenting a new feature, switch to the first Symfony
version which included it: ``2.5``, ``2.6``, etc.

**Step 4.** Create a dedicated **new branch** for your changes. This greatly
simplifies the work of reviewing and merging your changes. Use a short and
memorable name for the new branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout -b improve_install_chapter

**Step 5.** Now make your changes in the documentation. Add, tweak, reword and
even remove any content, but make sure that you comply with the
:doc:`/contributing/documentation/standards`.

**Step 6.** **Push** the changes to your forked repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git commit book/installation.rst
    $ git push origin improve_install_chapter

**Step 7.** Everything is now ready to initiate a **pull request**. Go to your
forked repository at ``https//github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/symfony-docs``
and click on the **Pull Requests** link located in the sidebar.

Then, click on the big **New pull request** button. As GitHub cannot guess the
exact changes that you want to propose, select the appropriate branches where
changes should be applied:

.. image:: /images/contributing/docs-pull-request-change-base.png
   :align: center

In this example, the **base fork** should be ``symfony/symfony-docs`` and
the **base** branch should be the ``2.3``, which is the branch that you selected
to base your changes on. The **head fork** should be your forked copy
of ``symfony-docs`` and the **compare** branch should be ``improve_install_chapter``,
which is the name of the branch you created and where you made your changes.

.. _pull-request-format:

**Step 8.** The last step is to prepare the **description** of the pull request.
To ensure that your work is reviewed quickly, please add the following table
at the beginning of your pull request description:

.. code-block:: text

    | Q             | A
    | ------------- | ---
    | Doc fix?      | [yes|no]
    | New docs?     | [yes|no] (PR # on symfony/symfony if applicable)
    | Applies to    | [Symfony version numbers this applies to]
    | Fixed tickets | [comma separated list of tickets fixed by the PR]

In this example, this table would look as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    | Q             | A
    | ------------- | ---
    | Doc fix?      | yes
    | New docs?     | no
    | Applies to    | all
    | Fixed tickets | #10575

**Step 9.** Now that you've successfully submitted your first contribution to the
Symfony documentation, **go and celebrate!**  The documentation managers will
carefully review your work in short time and they will let you know about any
required change.

In case you need to add or modify anything, there is no need to create a new
pull request. Just make sure that you are on the correct branch, make your
changes and push them:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd projects/symfony-docs/
    $ git checkout improve_install_chapter

    # ... do your changes

    $ git push

**Step 10.** After your pull request is eventually accepted and merged in the Symfony
documentation, you will be included in the `Symfony Documentation Contributors`_
list. Moreover, if you happen to have a SensioLabsConnect_ profile, you will
get a cool `Symfony Documentation Badge`_.

Your Second Documentation Contribution
--------------------------------------

The first contribution took some time because you had to fork the repository,
learn how to write documentation, comply with the pull requests standards, etc.
The second contribution will be much easier, except for one detail: given the
furious update activity of the Symfony documentation repository, odds are that
your fork is now out of date with the official repository.

Solving this problem requires you to `sync your fork`_ with the original repository.
To do this, execute this command first to tell git about the original repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd projects/symfony-docs/
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs.git

Now you can **sync your fork** by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd projects/symfony-docs/
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git checkout 2.3
    $ git merge upstream/2.3

This command will update the ``2.3`` branch, which is the one you used to
create the new branch for your changes. If you have used another base branch,
e.g. ``master``, replace the ``2.3`` with the appropriate branch name.

Great! Now you can proceed by following the same steps explained in the previous
section:

.. code-block:: bash

    # create a new branch to store your changes based on the 2.3 branch
    $ cd projects/symfony-docs/
    $ git checkout 2.3
    $ git checkout -b my_changes

    # ... do your changes

    # submit the changes to your forked repository
    $ git add xxx.rst     # (optional) only if this is a new content
    $ git commit xxx.rst
    $ git push origin my_changes

    # go to GitHub and create the Pull Request
    #
    # Include this table in the description:
    # | Q             | A
    # | ------------- | ---
    # | Doc fix?      | [yes|no]
    # | New docs?     | [yes|no] (PR # on symfony/symfony if applicable)
    # | Applies to    | [Symfony version numbers this applies to]
    # | Fixed tickets | [comma separated list of tickets fixed by the PR]

Your second contribution is now complete, so **go and celebrate again!**
You can also see how your ranking improves in the list of
`Symfony Documentation Contributors`_.

Your Next Documentation Contributions
-------------------------------------

Now that you've made two contributions to the Symfony documentation, you are
probably comfortable with all the Git-magic involved in the process. That's
why your next contributions would be much faster. Here you can find the complete
steps to contribute to the Symfony documentation, which you can use as a
**checklist**:

.. code-block:: bash

    # sync your fork with the official Symfony repository
    $ cd projects/symfony-docs/
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git checkout 2.3
    $ git merge upstream/2.3

    # create a new branch from the oldest maintained version
    $ git checkout 2.3
    $ git checkout -b my_changes

    # ... do your changes

    # add and commit your changes
    $ git add xxx.rst     # (optional) only if this is a new content
    $ git commit xxx.rst
    $ git push origin my_changes

    # go to GitHub and create the Pull Request
    #
    # Include this table in the description:
    # | Q             | A
    # | ------------- | ---
    # | Doc fix?      | [yes|no]
    # | New docs?     | [yes|no] (PR # on symfony/symfony if applicable)
    # | Applies to    | [Symfony version numbers this applies to]
    # | Fixed tickets | [comma separated list of tickets fixed by the PR]

    # (optional) make the changes requested by reviewers and commit them
    $ git commit xxx.rst
    $ git push

You guessed right: after all this hard work, it's **time to celebrate again!**


Review your changes
-------------------

Every GitHub Pull Request is automatically built and deployed by `Platform.sh`_
on a single environment that you can access on your browser to review your 
changes.

.. image:: /images/contributing/docs-pull-request-platformsh.png
   :align: center
   :alt:   Platform.sh Pull Request Deployment

To access the `Platform.sh`_ environment URL, simply go to your Pull Request 
page on GitHub and click on ``Details``.

.. note::

    The specific configuration files at the root of the Git repository: 
    ``.platform.app.yaml``, ``.platform/services.yaml`` and 
    ``.platform/routes.yaml`` allow `Platform.sh`_ to build Pull Requests.

.. note::

    Only Pull Requests to maintained branches are automatically built by
    Platform.sh. Check the `roadmap`_ for maintained branches.

Building from Source
--------------------

If you want to build documentation from source on your local machine, follow
these steps:

**Step 1.** Install pip_ (follow the `pip installation`_ chapter).

**Step 2.** Install Sphinx_ and `Sphinx Extensions for PHP and Symfony`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sphinx~=1.3.0 git+https://github.com/fabpot/sphinx-php.git

.. caution::

    You should install Sphinx and Shpinx extensions globally on your system. It
    means that above command should be executed as root user.

**Step 3.** Run ``make html`` and view the generated HTML in the ``_build/html``
directory.

Minor Changes (e.g. Typos)
--------------------------

You may find just a typo and want to fix it. Due to GitHub's functional
frontend, it is quite simple to create Pull Requests right in your
browser while reading the docs on symfony.com. To do this, just click
the **edit this page** button on the upper right corner. Beforehand,
please switch to the right branch as mentioned before. Now you are able
to edit the content and describe your changes within the GitHub
frontend. When your work is done, click **Propose file change** to
create a commit and, in case it is your first contribution, also your
fork. A new branch is created automatically in order to provide a base
for your Pull Request. Then fill out the form to create the Pull Request
as described above.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Why Do my Changes Take so Long to Be Reviewed and/or Merged?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please be patient. It can take up to several days before your pull request can
be fully reviewed. After merging the changes, it could take again several hours
before your changes appear on the symfony.com website.

Why Should I Use the Oldest Maintained Branch Instead of the Master Branch?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consistent with Symfony's source code, the documentation repository is split
into multiple branches, corresponding to the different versions of Symfony itself.
The ``master`` branch holds the documentation for the development branch of
the code.

Unless you're documenting a feature that was introduced after Symfony 2.3,
your changes should always be based on the ``2.3`` branch. Documentation managers
will use the necessary Git-magic to also apply your changes to all the active
branches of the documentation.

What If I Want to Submit my Work without Fully Finishing It?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can do it. But please use one of these two prefixes to let reviewers know
about the state of your work:

* ``[WIP]`` (Work in Progress) is used when you are not yet finished with your
  pull request, but you would like it to be reviewed. The pull request won't
  be merged until you say it is ready.

* ``[WCM]`` (Waiting Code Merge) is used when you're documenting a new feature
  or change that hasn't been accepted yet into the core code. The pull request
  will not be merged until it is merged in the core code (or closed if the
  change is rejected).

Would You Accept a Huge Pull Request with Lots of Changes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure that the changes are somewhat related. Otherwise, please create
separate pull requests. Anyway, before submitting a huge change, it's probably a
good idea to open an issue in the Symfony Documentation repository to ask the
managers if they agree with your proposed changes. Otherwise, they could refuse
your proposal after you put all that hard work into making the changes. We
definitely don't want you to waste your time!
