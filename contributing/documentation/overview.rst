Contributing to the Documentation
=================================

Documentation is as important as code. It follows the exact same principles:
DRY, tests, ease of maintenance, extensibility, optimization, and refactoring
just to name a few. And of course, documentation has bugs, typos, hard to read
tutorials, and more.

Contributing
------------

Before contributing, you need to become familiar with the :doc:`markup
language <format>` used by the documentation.

The Symfony2 documentation is hosted on GitHub:

.. code-block:: text

    https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs

If you want to submit a patch, `fork`_ the official repository on GitHub and
then clone your fork:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/symfony-docs.git

Unless you're documenting a feature that's new to Symfony 2.1, your changes
should be based on the 2.0 branch instead of the master branch. To do this
checkout the 2.0 branch before the next step:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout 2.0

Next, create a dedicated branch for your changes (for organization):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout -b improving_foo_and_bar

You can now make your changes directly to this branch and commit them. When
you're done, push this branch to *your* GitHub fork and initiate a pull request.
The pull request will be between your ``improving_foo_and_bar`` branch and
the ``symfony-docs`` ``master`` branch.

If you have made your changes based on the 2.0 branch then you need to follow
the change commit link and change the base branch to be @2.0:

GitHub covers the topic of `pull requests`_ in detail.

.. note::

    The Symfony2 documentation is licensed under a Creative Commons
    Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported :doc:`License <license>`.

.. tip::

    Your changes appear on the symfony.com website no more than 15 minutes
    after the documentation team merges your pull request. You can check if
    your changes have introduced some markup issues by going to the
    `Documentation Build Errors`_ page (it is updated each French night at 3AM
    when the server rebuilds the documentation).

Standards
---------

In order to help the reader as much as possible and to create code examples that
look and feel familiar, you should follow these rules:

* The code follows the :doc:`Symfony Coding Standards</contributing/code/standards>`
  as well as the `Twig Coding Standards`_;
* Each line should break approximately after the first word that crosses the
  72nd character (so most lines end up being 72-78 lines);
* When we fold one or more lines of code, we place ``...`` in a comment at the point
  of the fold. These comments are: ``// ...`` (php), ``# ...`` (yaml/bash), ``{# ... #}``
  (twig), ``<!-- ... -->`` (xml/html), ``; ...`` (ini), ``...`` (text);
* When we fold a part of a line, e.g. a variable value, we put ``...`` (without comment)
  at the place of the fold;
* Description of the folded code: (optional)
  If we fold several lines: the description of the fold can be placed after the ``...``
  If we fold only part of a line: the description can be placed before the line;
* If useful, a ``codeblock`` should begin with a comment containing the filename
  of the file in the code block. Don't place a blank line after this comment,
  unless the next line is also a comment;
* You should put a ``$`` in front of every bash line;
* We prefer the ``::`` shorthand over ``.. code-block:: php`` to begin a PHP
  code block.

An example::

    // src/Foo/Bar.php

    // ...
    class Bar
    {
        // ...

        public function foo($bar)
        {
            // set foo with a value of bar
            $foo = ...;

            // ... check if $bar has the correct value

            return $foo->baz($bar, ...);
        }
    }

.. note::

    * In Yaml you should put a space after ``{`` and before ``}`` (e.g. ``{ _controller: ... }``),
      but this should not be done in Twig (e.g. ``{'hello' : 'value'}``).
    * An array item is a part of a line, not a complete line. So you should
      not use ``// ...`` but ``...,`` (the comma because of the Coding Standards)::

        array(
            'some value',
            ...,
        )

Reporting an Issue
------------------

The most easy contribution you can make is reporting issues: a typo, a grammar
mistake, a bug in code example, a missing explanation, and so on.

Steps:

* Submit a bug in the bug tracker;

* *(optional)* Submit a patch.
