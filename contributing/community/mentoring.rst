Mentoring
=========

Reading the :doc:`contributing </contributing/index>` is already a great way
to get started on becoming a Symfony contributor. However, sometimes
it might still seem overwhelming - contributing can be complex! For this
purpose we created a dedicated `Symfony Slack`_ channel called `#mentoring`_
to connect new contributors to long-time contributors. This is a great way
to get one-on-one advice on the entire process. These long-time contributors
do really want to helpl new contributors - so feel free to ask anything!
