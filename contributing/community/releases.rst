The Release Process
===================

This document explains the Symfony release process (Symfony being the code
hosted on the main ``symfony/symfony`` `Git repository`_).

Symfony manages its releases through a *time-based model*; a new Symfony minor
version comes out every *six months*: one in *May* and one in *November*.

.. tip::

    The meaning of "minor" comes from the `Semantic Versioning`_ strategy.

Each minor version sticks to the same very well-defined process where we start
with a development period, followed by a maintenance period.

.. note::

    This release process has been adopted as of Symfony 2.2, and all the
    "rules" explained in this document must be strictly followed as of Symfony
    2.4.

.. _contributing-release-development:

Development
-----------

The full development period lasts six months and is divided into two phases:

* *Development*: *Four months* to add new features and to enhance existing
  ones;

* *Stabilisation*: *Two months* to fix bugs, prepare the release, and wait
  for the whole Symfony ecosystem (third-party libraries, bundles, and
  projects using Symfony) to catch up.

During the development phase, any new feature can be reverted if it won't be
finished in time or if it won't be stable enough to be included in the current
final release.

.. _contributing-release-maintenance:

Maintenance
-----------

Each Symfony minor version is maintained for a fixed period of time, depending
on the type of the release. We have two maintenance periods:

* *Bug fixes and security fixes*: During this period, all issues can be fixed.
  The end of this period is referenced as being the *end of maintenance* of a
  release.

* *Security fixes only*: During this period, only security related issues can
  be fixed. The end of this period is referenced as being the *end of
  life* of a release.

Standard Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A standard minor version is maintained for an *eight month* period for bug
fixes, and for a *fourteen month* period for security issue fixes.

Long Term Support Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every two years, a new Long Term Support Version (aka LTS version) is
published. Each LTS version is supported for a *three year* period for bug
fixes, and for a *four year* period for security issue fixes.

.. note::

    Paid support after the three year support provided by the community can
    also be bought from `SensioLabs`_.

Schedule
--------

Below is the schedule for the first few versions that use this release model:

.. image:: /images/contributing/release-process.jpg
   :align: center

* **Yellow** represents the Development phase
* **Blue** represents the Stabilisation phase
* **Green** represents the Maintenance period

This results in very predictable dates and maintenance periods:

=======  ==============  =======  ========================  ===========

.. [1] Symfony 2.4 maintenance has been `extended to September 2014`_.

.. tip::

    If you want to learn more about the timeline of any given Symfony version,
    use the online `timeline calculator`_. You can also get all data as a JSON
    string via a URL like `http://symfony.com/roadmap.json?version=2.x`.

.. tip::

    Whenever an important event related to Symfony versions happens (a version
    reaches end of maintenance or a new patch version is released for
    instance), you can automatically receive an email notification if you
    subscribed on the `roadmap notification`_ page.

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

Our :doc:`Backwards Compatibility Promise </contributing/code/bc>` is very
strict and allows developers to upgrade with confidence from one minor version
of Symfony to the next one.

Whenever keeping backward compatibility is not possible, the feature, the
enhancement or the bug fix will be scheduled for the next major version.

.. note::

    The work on a new major version of Symfony starts whenever enough major
    features breaking backward compatibility are waiting on the todo-list.

Deprecations
------------

When a feature implementation cannot be replaced with a better one without
breaking backward compatibility, there is still the possibility to deprecate
the old implementation and add a new preferred one along side. Read the
:ref:`conventions <contributing-code-conventions-deprecations>` document to
learn more about how deprecations are handled in Symfony.

Rationale
---------

This release process was adopted to give more *predictability* and
*transparency*. It was discussed based on the following goals:

* Shorten the release cycle (allow developers to benefit from the new
  features faster);
* Give more visibility to the developers using the framework and Open-Source
  projects using Symfony;
* Improve the experience of Symfony core contributors: everyone knows when a
  feature might be available in Symfony;
* Coordinate the Symfony timeline with popular PHP projects that work well
  with Symfony and with projects using Symfony;
* Give time to the Symfony ecosystem to catch up with the new versions
  (bundle authors, documentation writers, translators, ...).

The six month period was chosen as two releases fit in a year. It also allows
for plenty of time to work on new features and it allows for non-ready
features to be postponed to the next version without having to wait too long
for the next cycle.

The dual maintenance mode was adopted to make every Symfony user happy. Fast
movers, who want to work with the latest and the greatest, use the standard
version: a new version is published every six months, and there is a two months
period to upgrade. Companies wanting more stability use the LTS versions: a new
version is published every two years and there is a year to upgrade.
