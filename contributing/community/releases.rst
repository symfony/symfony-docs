The Release Process
===================

This document explains the **release process** of the Symfony project (i.e. the
code hosted on the main ``symfony/symfony`` `Git repository`_).

Symfony manages its releases through a *time-based model* and follows the
`Semantic Versioning`_ strategy:

* A new Symfony minor version (e.g. 2.8, 3.2, 4.1) comes out every *six months*:
  one in *May* and one in *November*;
* A new Symfony major version (e.g., 3.0, 4.0) comes out every *two years* and
  it's released at the same time of the last minor version of the previous major
  version.

.. _contributing-release-development:

Development
-----------

The full development period for any major or minor version lasts six months and
is divided into two phases:

* **Development**: *Four months* to add new features and to enhance existing
  ones;

* **Stabilization**: *Two months* to fix bugs, prepare the release, and wait
  for the whole Symfony ecosystem (third-party libraries, bundles, and
  projects using Symfony) to catch up.

During the development phase, any new feature can be reverted if it won't be
finished in time or if it won't be stable enough to be included in the current
final release.

.. _contributing-release-maintenance:

Maintenance
-----------

Each Symfony version is maintained for a fixed period of time, depending on the
type of the release. This maintenance is divided into:

* *Bug fixes and security fixes*: During this period, all issues can be fixed.
  The end of this period is referenced as being the *end of maintenance* of a
  release.

* *Security fixes only*: During this period, only security related issues can
  be fixed. The end of this period is referenced as being the *end of life* of
  a release.

.. note::

    The :doc:`maintenance document </contributing/code/maintenance>` describes
    the boundaries of acceptable changes during maintenance.

Symfony Versions
----------------

Standard Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **Standard Minor Version** is maintained for an *eight month* period for bug
fixes, and for a *fourteen month* period for security issue fixes.

In Symfony 2.x branch, the number of minor versions wasn't constrained, so that
branch ended up with nine minor versions (from 2.0 to 2.8). Starting from
3.x branch, the number of minor versions is limited to five (from X.0 to X.4).

.. _releases-lts:

Long Term Support Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every two years, a new **Long Term Support Version** (usually abbreviated as "LTS")
is published. Each LTS version is supported for a *three year* period for bug
fixes, and for a *four year* period for security issue fixes.

.. note::

    Paid support after the three year support provided by the community can
    also be bought from `SensioLabs`_.

In the Symfony 2.x branch, the LTS versions are 2.3, 2.7 and 2.8. Starting from the 3.x
branch, only the last minor version of each branch is considered LTS (e.g. 3.4,
4.4, 5.4, etc.)

Schedule
--------

Below is the schedule for the first few versions that use this release model:

* **Yellow** represents the Development phase
* **Blue** represents the Stabilization phase
* **Green** represents the Maintenance period

.. tip::

    If you want to learn more about the timeline of any given Symfony version,
    use the online `timeline calculator`_.

.. tip::

    Whenever an important event related to Symfony versions happens (a version
    reaches end of maintenance or a new patch version is released for
    instance), you can automatically receive an email notification if you
    subscribed on the `roadmap notification`_ page.

============  ==============  =======  ========================  ===========

.. [1] Symfony 2.4 maintenance has been `extended to September 2014`_.
.. [2] Symfony 2.8 is the last version of the Symfony 2.x branch.
.. [3] Symfony 3.0 is the first version to use the new release process based on five minor releases.

Backward Compatibility
----------------------

Our :doc:`Backward Compatibility Promise </contributing/code/bc>` is very
strict and allows developers to upgrade with confidence from one minor version
of Symfony to the next one.

Whenever keeping backward compatibility is not possible, the feature, the
enhancement or the bug fix will be scheduled for the next major version.

However, :doc:`Experimental Features </contributing/code/experimental>` are
**not** part of the backward compatibility promise and their APIs can change
from one minor version to the next. The changelog must explain the changes and
how to upgrade.

Deprecations
------------

When a feature implementation cannot be replaced with a better one without
breaking backward compatibility, there is still the possibility to deprecate
the old implementation and add a new preferred one along side. Read the
:ref:`conventions <contributing-code-conventions-deprecations>` document to
learn more about how deprecations are handled in Symfony.

Rationale
---------

This release process was adopted to give more *predictability* and
*transparency*. It was discussed based on the following goals:

* Shorten the release cycle (allow developers to benefit from the new
  features faster);
* Give more visibility to the developers using the framework and Open-Source
  projects using Symfony;
* Improve the experience of Symfony core contributors: everyone knows when a
  feature might be available in Symfony;
* Coordinate the Symfony timeline with popular PHP projects that work well
  with Symfony and with projects using Symfony;
* Give time to the Symfony ecosystem to catch up with the new versions
  (bundle authors, documentation writers, translators, ...).

The six month period was chosen as two releases fit in a year. It also allows
for plenty of time to work on new features and it allows for non-ready
features to be postponed to the next version without having to wait too long
for the next cycle.

The dual maintenance mode was adopted to make every Symfony user happy. Fast
movers, who want to work with the latest and the greatest, use the standard
version: a new version is published every six months, and there is a two months
period to upgrade. Companies wanting more stability use the LTS versions: a new
version is published every two years and there is a year to upgrade.
