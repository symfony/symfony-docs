IRC Meetings
============

The purpose of this meeting is to discuss topics in real time with many of the
Symfony2 devs.

Anyone may propose topics on the `symfony-dev`_ mailing-list until 24 hours
before the meeting, ideally including well prepared relevant information via
some URL. 24 hours before the meeting a link to a `doodle`_ will be posted
including a list of all proposed topics. Anyone can vote on the topics until
the beginning of the meeting to define the order in the agenda. Each topic
will be timeboxed to 15mins and the meeting lasts one hour, leaving enough
time for at least 4 topics.

.. caution::

    Note that its not the expected goal of them meeting to find final
    solutions, but more to ensure that there is a common understanding of the
    issue at hand and move the discussion forward in ways which are hard to
    achieve with less real time communication tools.

Meetings will happen each Thursday at 17:00 CET (+01:00) on the #symfony-dev
channel on the Freenode IRC server.

The IRC `logs`_ will later be published on the trac wiki, which will include a
short summary for each of the topics. Tickets will be created for any tasks or
issues identified during the meeting and referenced in the summary.

Some simple guidelines and pointers for participation:

* It's possible to change votes until the beginning of the meeting by clicking
  on "Edit an entry";
* The doodle will be closed for voting at the beginning of the meeting;
* Agenda is defined by which topics got the most votes in the doodle, or
  whichever was proposed first in case of a tie;
* At the beginning of the meeting one person will identify him/herself as the
  moderator;
* The moderator is essentially responsible for ensuring the 15min timebox and
  ensuring that tasks are clearly identified;
* Usually the moderator will also handle writing the summary and creating trac
  tickets unless someone else steps up;
* Anyone can join and is explicitly invited to participate;
* Ideally one should familiarize oneself with the proposed topic before the
  meeting;
* When starting on a new topic the proposer is invited to start things off
  with a few words;
* Anyone can then comment as they see fit;
* Depending on how many people participate one should potentially retrain
  oneself from pushing a specific argument too hard;
* Remember the IRC `logs`_ will be published later on, so people have the
  chance to review comments later on once more;
* People are encouraged to raise their hand to take on tasks defined during
  the meeting.
