Reporting a Bug
===============

Whenever you find a bug in Symfony, we kindly ask you to report it. It helps
us make a better Symfony.

.. caution::

    If you think you've found a security issue, please use the special
    :doc:`procedure <security>` instead.

Before submitting a bug:

* Double-check the official :doc:`documentation </index>` to see if you're not misusing the
  framework;

* Ask for assistance on the `users mailing-list`_, the `forum`_, or on the
  #symfony `IRC channel`_ if you're not sure if your issue is really a bug.

If your problem definitely looks like a bug, report it using the official bug
`tracker`_ and follow some basic rules:

* Use the title field to clearly describe the issue;

* Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short code examples
  (providing a unit test that illustrates the bug is best);

* If the bug you experienced affects more than one layer, providing a simple
  failing unit test may not be sufficient. In this case, please fork the
  `Symfony Standard Edition`_ and reproduce your issue on a new branch;

* Give as much detail as possible about your environment (OS, PHP version,
  Symfony version, enabled extensions, ...);

* *(optional)* Attach a :doc:`patch <patches>`.
