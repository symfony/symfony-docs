Conventions
===========

The :doc:`standards` document describes the coding standards for the Symfony2
projects and the internal and third-party bundles. This document describes
coding standards and conventions used in the core framework to make it more
consistent and predictable. You are encouraged to follow them in your own
code, but you don't need to.

Method Names
------------

When an object has a "main" many relation with related "things"
(objects, parameters, ...), the method names are normalized:

  * ``get()``
  * ``set()``
  * ``has()``
  * ``all()``
  * ``replace()``
  * ``remove()``
  * ``clear()``
  * ``isEmpty()``
  * ``add()``
  * ``register()``
  * ``count()``
  * ``keys()``

The usage of these methods are only allowed when it is clear that there
is a main relation:

* a ``CookieJar`` has many ``Cookie`` objects;

* a Service ``Container`` has many services and many parameters (as services
  is the main relation, we use the naming convention for this relation);

* a Console ``Input`` has many arguments and many options. There is no "main"
  relation, and so the naming convention does not apply.

For many relations where the convention does not apply, the following methods
must be used instead (where ``XXX`` is the name of the related thing):

+----------------+-------------------+
| Main Relation  | Other Relations   |
+================+===================+
| ``get()``      | ``getXXX()``      |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``set()``      | ``setXXX()``      |
+----------------+-------------------+
| n/a            | ``replaceXXX()``  |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``has()``      | ``hasXXX()``      |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``all()``      | ``getXXXs()``     |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``replace()``  | ``setXXXs()``     |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``remove()``   | ``removeXXX()``   |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``clear()``    | ``clearXXX()``    |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``isEmpty()``  | ``isEmptyXXX()``  |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``add()``      | ``addXXX()``      |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``register()`` | ``registerXXX()`` |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``count()``    | ``countXXX()``    |
+----------------+-------------------+
| ``keys()``     | n/a               |
+----------------+-------------------+

.. note::

    While "setXXX" and "replaceXXX" are very similar, there is one notable 
    difference: "setXXX" may replace, or add new elements to the relation. 
    "replaceXXX" on the other hand is specifically forbidden to add new 
    elements, but most throw an exception in these cases.
