Security Issues
===============

This document explains how Symfony security issues are handled by the Symfony
core team (Symfony being the code hosted on the main ``symfony/symfony`` `Git
repository`_).

Reporting a Security Issue
--------------------------

If you think that you have found a security issue in Symfony, don't use the
mailing-list or the bug tracker and don't publish it publicly. Instead, all
security issues must be sent to **security [at] symfony.com**. Emails sent to
this address are forwarded to the Symfony core-team private mailing-list.

Resolving Process
-----------------

For each report, we first try to confirm the vulnerability. When it is
confirmed, the core-team works on a solution following these steps:

1. Send an acknowledgement to the reporter;
2. Work on a patch;
3. Get a CVE identifier from mitre.org;
3. Write a security announcement for the official Symfony `blog`_ about the
   vulnerability. This post should contain the following information:

   * a title that always include the "Security release" string;
   * a description of the vulnerability;
   * the affected versions;
   * the possible exploits;
   * how to patch/upgrade/workaround affected applications;
   * the CVE identifier;
   * credits.
4. Send the patch and the announcement to the reporter for review;
5. Apply the patch to all maintained versions of Symfony;
6. Package new versions for all affected versions;
7. Publish the post on the official Symfony `blog`_ (it must also be added to
   the "`Security Advisories`_" category);
8. Update the security advisory list (see below).

.. note::

    Releases that include security issues should not be done on Saturday or
    Sunday, except if the vulnerability has been publicly posted.

.. note::

    While we are working on a patch, please do not reveal the issue publicly.
