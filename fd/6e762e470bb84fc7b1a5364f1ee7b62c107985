Build failure is unrelated to this PR. This has been fixed in #8772.

This looks good. Can you also add an entry to the redirection map?

Yea, I agree. We just need to add `use_microseconds` to the "Full Default configuration" with maybe one line of `# comments` above it to give a short description. That would actually be AWESOME

I am unsure about the comments. They are long right now, and that is the incorrect way according to the feedback @weaverryan gave in https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/8770#issuecomment-348312420. See commit https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/8770/commits/4b3ed43060414955021a8ba80b4802326fb67cd4 about the changes.

I'd love to get better comment texts to include instead of these long lines cluttering the article since this is such a small change.

@javiereguiluz No problem. It is good that we all pay attention so that the quality of the documentation remains high.
