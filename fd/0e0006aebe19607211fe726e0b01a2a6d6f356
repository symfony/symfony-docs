shall we move it to an include instead of duplicating it? or is it not exactly the same content?

Include: I dont't know how to do that.

Differences:
* I deleted the term "database". I could come up with another PR at Doctrine, using a more general term like "credentials" or anything.
* And I added some more example characters. These are not so important, and I could add them at Doctrine too.

So if you go for the include, I'll take care of the fine tuning :-)

BTW: I'm not 100% sure if Swift Mailer does indeed use the same decoding as Doctrine, see https://github.com/symfony/swiftmailer-bundle/issues/270 . Is this just a (temporary) bug or a real difference?
