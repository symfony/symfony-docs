I don't like the original content ... but I'm not fan either of the proposal based on "diff" (because it makes the example too long). Here's another proposal for your consideration:

1. Uncomment the `addPart()` code
2. Add something like this comment above that code: `// you can remove the following code if you don't define a text version for your emails`
