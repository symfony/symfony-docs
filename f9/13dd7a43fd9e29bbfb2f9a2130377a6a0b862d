@tiraeth can you please update this PR to fix the comment made by @xabbuh ? And can you please rebase this, it seems to have merge conflicts in the current state.

After that, @weaverryan should merge this since the upstream PR is merged (that's why I removed `[WCM]`)

Sure thing. Will do so shortly.

Made it up to date with ``symfony-docs/master`` and squashed everything to a single commit.
