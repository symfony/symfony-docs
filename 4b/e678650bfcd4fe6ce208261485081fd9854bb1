"each" and "every" can be used in cases like this afaik. Let's see how our natives think about it

@WouterJ Yes, but then you have to omit "the".

@xabbuh Yep. So basically it would be:

* either "that help you render the HTML widget, label and error for each field";
* or "that help you render each HTML widget, label and error for each field".

@fabschurt I'm in favor of the last option. Can you please update this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@WouterJ Done ;-) I did a `git push --force` in order to keep only 1 commit for the PR, I don't know if it's the best way to go?

:+1: Nice change.

@fabschurt Squashing commits is not necessary, but we are happy if you do it anyway. :)

Heh heh, this kind of things is trickier than it sounds :-) I updated the PR, we should be good to go now.
