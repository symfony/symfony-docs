Thanks for your contribution @vudaltsov. Can you explain why you think we need to make this change? As you can see in the list right below the paragraph we actually have five form themes.

@xabbuh yes, there are five themes in the list, but `four` is used in the sentence "Symfony comes with **four** built-in form themes". I suggest changing `four` to `five`
