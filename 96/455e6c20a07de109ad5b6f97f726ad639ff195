Work in progress. I'm still looking for other listings to normalize them.

Sure!

I'm reviewing the docs looking for them. Thank you for the list :)

Looks good so far. Let's see what Travis reports.

@pedronofuentes Travis is happy with your changes. :) Just let us know when you think you're finished or when you need additional help.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@xabbuh I had pending some changes in the Book section:

http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_fundamentals.html#standalone-tools-the-symfony-components
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/templating.html#template-naming-and-locations
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/templating.html#global-template-variables
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/validation.html#validation-groups
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html#field-type-options-guessing
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html#rendering-a-form-in-a-template
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html#symfony-reverse-proxy
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html#public-vs-private-responses
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html#using-esi-in-symfony
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/internals.html#events
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/internals.html#kernel-response-event

My idea is continue with the next big sections. But maybe it's better to merge this pull request (if Travis wants) and I would make another one if I see more changes.

Is that OK?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-12-02T18:59:57Z

@pedronofuentes I think it's okay to merge this now.

@WouterJ What do you think?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2014-12-17T09:12:17Z

I'd love to see this PR merged. @WouterJ is there anything left that should be completed? Thanks!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-12-17T09:15:44Z

@WouterJ Can you merge as is or do we need a rebase?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2014-12-17T12:20:21Z

I can't merge this using GH atm, it would be easier if it was rebased.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-12-17T13:12:08Z

@pedronofuentes Can you rebase here?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by pedronofuentes at 2014-12-17T13:30:49Z

@xabbuh of course.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by pedronofuentes at 2014-12-17T16:41:20Z

@xabbuh done!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2014-12-17T16:42:40Z

@pedronofuentes thanks for your great work removing these inconsistencies!
