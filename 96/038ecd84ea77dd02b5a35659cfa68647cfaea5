Perfect. Thank you very much for documenting this @javiereguiluz!

After a second check, I think that the property will be considered writable if it has associated adder **and** remover methods. If only one of them is present, the PropertyAccessor component cannot update reliably the array, and so doesn't do it.

Should be:

```php
<?php

<?php

class SomeClass
{
    private $analyses;
    private $feet;

    public function addAnalyse(Dummy $analyse)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function removeAnalyse(Dummy $analyse)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function addFoot(Dummy $foot)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function removeFoot(Dummy $foot)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Thanks for reviewing KÃ©vin. This is a bit confusing, because I took the original example from the tests of your pull request: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/18337/files#diff-cf4f68ffc8f26be7f990461bb282f50cR126

I have checked this again and you are right ... it checks by default both array mutator methods (add and remove) to determine if it's writable or not. Thanks!
