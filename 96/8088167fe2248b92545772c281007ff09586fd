It's been more than a month, any news?

I fixed the typo mentioned by @xabbuh. If you have any other feedback to provide, I'd be glad to hear it.

@lemoinem Can you please change that everywhere in the parts you modified (the same by the way also applies to "Form Type").

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@xabbuh Done! (:

@lemoinem This looks great now! Could you do another rebase please (sorry for that, but we had some activity on the repo the last days)?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lemoinem at 2015-06-23T18:35:19Z

@xabbuh Thanks for the feedback!

Here is the rebase. Enjoy!

:+1: thanks for this @lemoinem Reducing doc duplication is a big plus for us!

@weaverryan : Thanks for the feedback. Here is a new tentative version with a more positive wording.

Let me know what you think about it. Once we all agree on a better version, I will squash the commits and rebase.

@weaverryan @xabbuh
It's been a bit more than 2 months since the last modification regarding this PR. Any feedback? Is the last wording appropriate? If so, Should I squash the commits so it could all be merged?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the ping! I just left one small comment - but a :+1: from me! A merger can even add that small change of we get to it first :) (unfortunately I'm on my phone now!)

@weaverryan
I added a mention regarding `getExtendedType`. A more detailed code block seemed redundant with the rest of the article (especially with the Defining a Form Type Extension section).

If everything is OK, I'll squash it all and rebase.
