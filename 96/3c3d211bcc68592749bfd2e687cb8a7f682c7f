I've probably forgot some things, feel free to list them here. ping @symfony/mergers

What about refactorings which don't provide significant performance improvements? Example: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/18227/files

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2016-03-30T13:19:46Z

Another use case: removal of legacy code which was left over by mistake. Example: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/18299/files

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2016-03-30T13:23:26Z

Another use case: changes related to design. I'd like to redesign the exception page, the Symfony Requirements check webpage, etc. to match the new design of the toolbar, profiler, welcome page, etc. Would that be allowed?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@javiereguiluz

Refactorings: I would say no
Removal of legacy code: yes, that's a bug
Design fixes, yes, design changes, no

Another one: adding tests for untested features present in old branches.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2016-03-30T13:27:30Z

A question: changing the visibility of properties/methods is considered a new feature? Example: adding a getter for one property: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/18143/files

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2016-03-30T13:31:22Z

Another question: where does "Upgrading ICU data" fit? It was merged on 2.3: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/18019

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-03-30T13:32:51Z

Keep in mind that I'm not documenting the current way as it is inconsistent at times. That's why I want to write some rules for the future (what we've done in the past is irrelevant but useful to draw the line in the sand).

both are new features

I would accept this in maintenance branches, as it helps preventing regressions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/12425#issuecomment-202892373 for example ?

@fabpot We need to add a reference to the new file to `/contributing/map.rst.inc` too.

I propose also something like:
> It is also designed to enable a continuous upgrade path that allows one to move forward with newest Symfony versions in the safest way. One should be able to move PHP versions, OS or Symfony versions almost independently. That's the reason why e.g. supporting latest PHP versions or OS features is considered as bug fixes.

What about using a definition list instead of the unordered lists?
```rst
**Performance improvements**
    Performance improvements should [...]
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-04-10T17:23:35Z

@WouterJ because this is really a list.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-04-10T17:23:48Z

I've taken into account all comments, should be better now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2016-05-21T08:42:19Z

@symfony/mergers can you please make a decision on this PR? From a doc point of view, it's ready to be merged but I'm not sure if this is already accepted by the core team.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2016-05-21T17:10:57Z

I've re-read it again and I'm üëç

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-05-23T08:55:47Z

I would merge this as we can always tweak the rules easily if we think they need to be refined based on our experience. Looks good to me as version 1
