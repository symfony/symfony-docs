@ogizanagi You are right, we still have to add them manually.

We've just deployed a change to add `Messenger` to the list of guides: https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html

@javiereguiluz : Great, thank you!

I think we should reference it as well in the component documentation (in the "Learn more" section like for the [Serializer component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/serializer.html#learn-more) or instance). It's not easily discoverable otherwise.
