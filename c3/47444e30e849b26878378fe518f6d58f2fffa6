I'm fine with targeting 3.3 since at the time of its release PHP 5 was not maintained anymore.

I am not convinced that we should handle the `2.x` branches differently. IMO we could safely merge this into the `2.7` branch.

WDYT @javiereguiluz @Simperfit @HeahDude ? Maybe merge this into `2.7` will mean less differences and thus, less maintenance?

The real problem I see with this proposal is that the move from PHP 5 to 7 or *vice versa* is not automatic. Sometimes `php5` turns into `php7` (e.g. `Action php5-fcgi /php5-fcgi` -> `Action php7-fcgi /php7-fcgi`) and sometimes `php5` turns into `php7.1` (e.g. `listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock` -> `listen = /var/run/php7.1-fpm.sock`).

If the changes were consistent (`php5` -> `php7` or `php7` -> `php5`) then I wouldn't see any issue making this change. For now, I have some concerns.

To be more clear about the "sometimes" part, I think it boils down to how apache and php-fpm are packaged on Ubuntu. Can someone using apache confirm that there is no minor version in apache config files for php 7?

@javiereguiluz I don't really understand your concerns. As I read blog posts, it feels like Apache always will be `php7-fcgi` and the FPM socket `php7.1-fpm.sock`. I don't think it'll change, or at least, I don't think we can force the Linux developers to change this naming :)

I'm :+1: for making the docs assume PHP 7 (also in the PHP code examples).

@wouterj my concern was that the transform from PHP 7 to 5 is not consistent. If all changes where `php7` -> `php5` or `php5` -> `php7` then I can read some config file and transform it into the other PHP version. However, now it looks like a lottery: sometimes is `php7` and sometimes `php7.1` so I don't know if I have to change everything to `php5` or `php5` and `php5.6` for example.

Well, I think it works just the other way around: If you setup config, I really don't think you should be using PHP 5.x anymore. So you just can read the Symfony docs and see the PHP 7 config.

In the current situation, you see the PHP 5.x config. You don't have any idea how to change this to PHP 7 and changing 5 to 7, it doesn't work (in all cases).

To make both worlds perfect, we can add comments with the PHP 5 way. But I think we it's engouh to make the PHP 7 world perfect :)

I don't agree with this comment:

> I really don't think you should be using PHP 5.x anymore

Developers are not stupid. They know PHP 7 exists and it's better than PHP 5. They'd love to use PHP 7. But sometimes, for some reasons that can't be changed, you must still use PHP 5.

In any case, Symfony goes full PHP 7.1 in two months, so let's change this! 👍

i'm agree with this change too 👍

I don't think @wouterj was suggesting that. I think he was just saying that nowadays, when you start a project, it is more likely that you are using php 7.1 .
