What's our official recommendation for existing third-party bundles that no longer support 3.4. Do we encourage them to upgrade their structure or it's better to use this only in brand-new bundles?

Related to the previous question, even if we don't recommend to change the structure for existing bundles, can you think of any problem if they do? Thanks!

As long as the old structure is kept alive, I don't think we should encourage upgrading, at least not now. Maybe when we start deprecating the old structure.

As long as the bundle is strictly compatible with Sf >= 4.4 shouldn't be a problem ðŸ¤ž

maybe the doc should have a note saying that this structure can be used only when requiring `symfony/http-kernel` 4.4+ only, to avoid issues with bundle migrating to it (due to reading the new doc) without changing their min version.

Updated:
 * @stof, comments addressed and added `versionadded::` note.
 * @OskarStark, rebased on 4.4 branch.
 * consistent vendor/bundle naming
