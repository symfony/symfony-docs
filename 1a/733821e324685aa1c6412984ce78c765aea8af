I thought the same, but I would prefer we do this after the release of Symfony 6, to reduce merge conflicts, WDYT?

Yes ... but there shouldn't be conflicts, right? Only if we change the contents of these directives, which is extremely rare. But maybe I'm missing something.

We will for example a new bridge in 5.4 will always cause a conflict
