@vudaltsov you know Symfony Forms very well. If you have some time, could you please review this proposal? Thanks a lot!

@javiereguiluz I would like to have some feedback to https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/9254#discussion_r170543624 before merging.

I will give that feedback today, I will try to use those events the way you explain and we'll discuss it.
As for the other two changes, I am 👍

I tried to add a field on a `SUBMIT` event to the current form and although it didn't throw any exceptions and the field appeared in the view, the data was not handled and did not appear in the result array.

```php
$builder = $this->createFormBuilder()
    ->add('children', FormType::class)
    ->add('submit', SubmitType::class, [
        'attr' => ['class' => 'btn btn-black']
    ]);

$builder
    ->get('children')
    ->add('text', TextType::class)
    ->addEventListener(FormEvents::SUBMIT, function (FormEvent $event) {
        $event->getForm()->add('textarea', TextareaType::class);
    });

$form = $builder
    ->getForm()
    ->handleRequest($request);
```

So I think the notice is correct and should not be removed.

I noticed that [ResizeFormListener](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Core/EventListener/ResizeFormListener.php#L144) actually removes fields from the listened form on `SUBMIT` but I don't think this possibility is worth mentioning in the docs.

Ok, I reverted the notice removal.
