I tried to do a PR into the 2.7 branch but it showed me about 300+ files changed so I wasn't certain if it would be ok :)
I checked the ValidationListener before making the change and as far as I could check it never did anything else than to validate the object.

We should be able to easily merge this into 2.7 with the merge tool.
