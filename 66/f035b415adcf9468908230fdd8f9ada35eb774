Updated this PR. I did not add a section about the advantages and drawbacks, I don't have enough knowledge to write these down. However, I added a quick tip to improve the speed of the application on Homestead. I would like to link to http://www.whitewashing.de/2013/08/19/speedup_symfony2_on_vagrant_boxes.html , but I guess that's not possible due to symfony.com's external linking policy (/cc @javiereguiluz)?
