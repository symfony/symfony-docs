@nasaralla thanks for your first contribution to this repository. However, this is not really an error but a decision. We decided to not include any PHP opening tag in the docs (here you have more details: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/8324#issuecomment-326307432) Other frameworks do the same in their docs.

-----

Now a comment directed at the people who manage this repository: @weaverryan, @xabbuh, @wouterj and @HeahDude. What do you think about adding `<?php` just to this article which is the first one that Symfony newcomers read?

In 2015 some people asked us to add it (https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/5741) but we said no.

In 2016 some people asked us to add it (https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/6389) but we said no.

In 2017 some people asked us to add it (https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/8324) but we said no.

When lots of people ask you to change your decision ... you probably made a wrong decision.

The reasons for closing https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/5741 are still valid IMO.
What about a little `Prerequisite` section dedicated to new comers that we could link in the introduction of some guides to explain that Symfony cannot be mastered without basic knowledge of PHP with a link to its docs and where we could mention that we make use of a ton of code examples without explicit opening tag.

I don't think they'll read an external document. The thing is that if you are a newcomer and reading the first tutorial of some project, you probably copy+paste things without much thinking to test them in your browser. That's why I do at least ðŸ˜… , so I expect my first copy+paste to work perfectly.

I also think like @javiereguiluz that the first read is worth special attention and may warrant a different policy

This may also give a bad habit :), and can be frustrating when the first works and not the others.

I have no hard feeling on this, but my point is that we better learn from mistakes than from things working out of the box.
We should not copy/paste code without trying to understand if it's what we expect, people doing so should make the mistake to understand it and not do it anymore.
For that I would not change this example.

Again, I'm fine either way, just expressing another opinion here :).

Sure, but when you doubt, things are not working and you do _exactly_ as said in the docs and it's not working, it's a desperate situation and if it's only for one `<?php` tag it's really infuriating :)

But I do think it's only valid for that specific page.

Well for me I am doing php for 9 / 10 years ... and even I didn't spot that

+1 for adding it to the intro docs. And maybe to other docs later, but letâ€™s start there. I have always seen people copy code in trainings and try to debug their missing open php tag (which is really tricky). Just last month it happened to maybe 10% if a conference workshop.

I think itâ€™s time to be pragmatic.

Could we add this automatically when PHP code blocks are rendered?

@xabbuh that's actually a very nice idea. I've put together some quick CSS styles:

```css
.highlight-php .highlight pre {
    position: relative;
    padding-top: 30px;
}
.highlight-php .linenos {
    padding-top: 30px;
}
.highlight-php .highlight pre::before{
    content: "<?php";
    color: #999;
    position: absolute;
    top: 5px
}
```

And this is how it looks:

There's a problem though: content generated via CSS is not selectable ðŸ˜¢
