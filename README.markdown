>**Note**
>Unless you're documenting a feature that was introduced *after* Symfony 2.3 
>(e.g. in Symfony 2.4), all pull requests must be based off of the **2.3** branch,
>**not** the master or older branches.

We love contributors! For more information on how you can contribute to the
Symfony documentation, please read
