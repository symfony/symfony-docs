@xabbuh beware that if we change any title of any section, links will be broken. For internal anchors is not that important I guess, but for the title of the chapters, this would be a big problem. Example: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4205/files#diff-7c476141c8e94caded7e7fc0707ff263R1

@javiereguiluz Hm, that's true. How do we deal with this? Could adding explicit labels with the outdated headline be an option?

I added labels for all modified headlines.
