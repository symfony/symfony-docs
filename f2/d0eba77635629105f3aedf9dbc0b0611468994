Some questions:

* Is this really necessary? None of the bundles in my `vendor` dir has it:
> By convention, the getName() method of the bundle class should return the class name.

* It also works without an alias. For configuration in `services.yaml`, it's recommended (with autowiring) to use just the service namespace as id. So is this still relevant at all? Or just in some (which?) cases?
> Each bundle has an alias, which is the lower-cased short version of the bundle name using underscores (acme_blog for AcmeBlogBundle). This alias is used to enforce uniqueness within a project and for defining bundle's configuration options (see below for some usage examples).
