@OskarStark thanks for adding this tip about squashing commits.

However, I'd like to propose to not merge this PR and even to remove any reference to commit squashing. Why? Because Symfony project uses a proprietary tool which automatically squashes all commits before merging. That's why on `symfony` and `symfony-doc` we no longer ask users to squash their commits.

The less hurdles we define for collaborating with Symfony, the better.

Hey @javiereguiluz

@OskarStark if the Symfony doc managers agree on removing any reference to squashing commits, I agree with you about explaining that we no longer require squashing. Thanks.

For me, that's okay. But I leave the final word to @weaverryan and @WouterJ who do the actual merges.
