Thank you, @OskarStark!

- Could the "short timeframe" be defined, like `x` weeks before release?
- Could this be reflect on the [Symfony Releases Calendar](https://symfony.com/releases#symfony-releases-calendar)?

Not sure, as this is not a _hard_, more a _soft_ deadline, lets ask @nicolas-grekas and @fabpot

> Could this be reflect on the [Symfony Releases Calendar](https://symfony.com/releases#symfony-releases-calendar)?

Not sure it's worth, but possibly yes. But once done, @carsonbot could use that information

We already document this as the "stabilization" period of two months here: https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html#development

I agree, but this does not really explain what that mean for the contributor

I don't think that this is needed as this is already described here: https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html#development

Maybe adding a link to this paragraph would be enough.

I agree that we should not duplicate the release cycle documentation, but I like mentioning it on this page. It's common to see contributors confused what they should do with their PR during this phase. What about replacing the strong warning with a more subtle paragraph like:

```rst
During the :ref:`stabilization phase <contributing-release-development>`, the development branch is in
feature freeze. Please help the community prepare for the new version release. If you want to submit a
new feature pull request, you should target the next version. For example, if ``6.3`` reached feature
freeze, new features should target ``6.4``. If the ``6.4`` branch does not yet exists, target ``6.3``
and rebase your pull requests once the branch is created.
```

(second sentence may be removed, I can't help myself pushing everyone to not focus on writing new features during these 2 months :stuck_out_tongue: )

That works for me
