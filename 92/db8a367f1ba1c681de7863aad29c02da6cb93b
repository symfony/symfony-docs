Could you to update the framework reference to add the default path option? https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/8634/files#diff-c0c158a40398b72fa4f0c9d0accbc169

@yceruto sorry but I can't. I don't see the default_path in my branch or in 4.0. Is this only on master?

@javiereguiluz are you asking by Symfony repo or docs? I don't understand the question :/

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.4/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/DependencyInjection/Configuration.php#L680

https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/8634/files#diff-c0c158a40398b72fa4f0c9d0accbc169 It needs to be added to the framework reference?

yes, I was referring to the docs ... but I'm probably wrong.

@javiereguiluz He already did the work for you :). @yceruto just wants you to import his work from another PR: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/8634/files#diff-c0c158a40398b72fa4f0c9d0accbc169
