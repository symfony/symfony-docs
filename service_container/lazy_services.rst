Lazy Services
=============

.. seealso::

    Another way to inject services lazily is via a :doc:`service locator </service_container/service_locators>`.

Why Lazy Services?
------------------

In some cases, you may want to inject a service that is a bit heavy to instantiate,
but is not always used inside your object. For example, imagine you have
a ``NewsletterManager`` and you inject a ``mailer`` service into it. Only
a few methods on your ``NewsletterManager`` actually use the ``mailer``,
but even when you don't need it, a ``mailer`` service is always instantiated
in order to construct your ``NewsletterManager``.

Configuring lazy services is one answer to this. With a lazy service, a
"proxy" of the ``mailer`` service is actually injected. It looks and acts
just like the ``mailer``, except that the ``mailer`` isn't actually instantiated
until you interact with the proxy in some way.

Installation
------------

In order to use the lazy service instantiation, you will first need to install
the ``ocramius/proxy-manager`` package:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require ocramius/proxy-manager

.. note::

    If you're not using the full-stack framework, you also have to install the
    `ProxyManager bridge`_

    .. code-block:: terminal

        $ composer require symfony/proxy-manager-bridge

Configuration
-------------

You can mark the service as ``lazy`` by manipulating its definition:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        services:
           AppBundle\Twig\AppExtension:
             lazy:  true

    .. code-block:: xml

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd">

            <services>
                <service id="AppBundle\Twig\AppExtension" lazy="true" />
            </services>
        </container>

    .. code-block:: php

        use AppBundle\Twig\AppExtension;

        $container->register(AppExtension::class)
            ->setLazy(true);

Once you inject the service into another service, a virtual `proxy`_ with the
same signature of the class representing the service should be injected. The
same happens when calling ``Container::get()`` directly.

The actual class will be instantiated as soon as you try to interact with the
service (e.g. call one of its methods).

To check if your proxy works you can simply check the interface of the
received object::

    dump(class_implements($service));
    // the output should include "ProxyManager\Proxy\LazyLoadingInterface"

.. note::

    If you don't install the `ProxyManager bridge`_ and the
    `ocramius/proxy-manager`_, the container will just skip over the ``lazy``
    flag and simply instantiate the service as it would normally do.
