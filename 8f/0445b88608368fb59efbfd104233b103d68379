"Allow to validate" isn't completely wrong, but "allow validating" is indeed better, see e.g. https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/60271/grammatical-complements-for-allow

Yes, you are right. "To Validate" is used frequently in the text, I just wanted to minimize the number a bit. Makes it easier to read.
