How to Master and Create new Environments
=========================================

Every application is the combination of code and a set of configuration that
dictates how that code should function. The configuration may define the database
being used, if something should be cached or how verbose logging should be.

In Symfony, the idea of "environments" is the idea that the same codebase can be
run using multiple different configurations. For example, the ``dev`` environment
should use configuration that makes development easy and friendly, while the
``prod`` environment should use a set of configuration optimized for speed.

   single: Environments; Configuration files

Different Environments, different Configuration Files
-----------------------------------------------------

A typical Symfony application begins with three environments: ``dev``,
``prod`` and ``test``. As mentioned, each environment represents a way to
execute the same codebase with different configuration. It should be no
surprise then that each environment loads its own individual configuration
files. These different files are organized by environment:

* for the ``dev`` environment: ``config/packages/dev/``
* for the ``prod`` environment: ``config/packages/prod/``
* for the ``test`` environment: ``config/packages/test/``

In reality, each environment differs only somewhat from others. This means that
all environments share a large base of common configurations. This configuration
is put in files directly in the ``config/packages/`` directory.

The location of these files is defined by the application's kernel::

    // src/Kernel.php

    // ...
    class Kernel extends BaseKernel
    {
        // ...

        protected function configureContainer(ContainerBuilder $container, LoaderInterface $loader)
        {
            // ...
            $confDir = $this->getProjectDir().'/config';

            // always load all files in /config/packages/
            $loader->load($confDir.'/packages/*'.self::CONFIG_EXTS, 'glob');

            // then, if available, load the files in the specific environment directory
            if (is_dir($confDir.'/packages/'.$this->environment)) {
                $loader->load($confDir.'/packages/'.$this->environment.'/**/*'.self::CONFIG_EXTS, 'glob');
            }

            // load a special services.(yaml/xml/php) and, if available, services_ENVIRONMENT.(yaml/xml/php) file
            $loader->load($confDir.'/services'.self::CONFIG_EXTS, 'glob');
            $loader->load($confDir.'/services_'.$this->environment.self::CONFIG_EXTS, 'glob');
        }
    }

Take the framework package, installed by default, as an example:

* Loaded in all environments, ``config/packages/framework.yaml`` configures the
  framework with some ``secret`` setting;
* In the **prod** environment, nothing extra will be set as there is no
  ``config/packages/prod/`` directory;
* The same applies to **dev**, as there is no
  ``config/packages/dev/framework.yaml``. There are however other packages (e.g.
  ``routing.yaml``) with special dev settings;
* At last, during the **test** environment, the framework's test features are
  enabled in ``config/packages/test/framework.yaml``.

   single: Environments; Executing different environments

Executing an Application in different Environments
--------------------------------------------------

To execute the application in each environment, change the ``APP_ENV``
environment variable. During development, this is done in ``.env``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # .env
    APP_ENV=dev

    # or for test:
    #APP_ENV=test

Visit the ``http://localhost:8000/index.php`` page in your web browser to see
your application in the configured environment.

.. tip::

    In production, it is recommended to configure the environment variables in
    your :ref:`web server configuration <configuration-env-var-in-prod>`.

.. note::

    The given URLs assume that your web server is configured to use the ``public/``
    directory of the application as its root. Read more in :doc:`Installing Symfony </setup>`.

If you open the file you just visited (``public/index.php``), you'll see that
the environment variable is passed to the kernel::

    // public/index.php

    // ...
    $kernel = new Kernel($_SERVER['APP_ENV'] ?? 'dev', $_SERVER['APP_DEBUG'] ?? false);

    // ...

You can also replace ``$_SERVER['APP_ENV'] ?? 'dev'`` by just ``'dev'`` to
always run the application in the dev environment, independent of the
``APP_ENV`` variable.

.. note::

    The ``test`` environment is used when writing functional tests and is
    usually not accessed in the browser directly via a front controller.

.. index::
   single: Configuration; Debug mode

.. sidebar:: *Debug* Mode

    Important, but unrelated to the topic of *environments* is the second
    argument to the ``Kernel`` constructor. This specifies if the application
    should run in "debug mode". Regardless of the environment, a Symfony
    application can be run with debug mode set to ``true`` or ``false``
    (respectively ``1`` or ``0`` for the ``APP_DEBUG`` variable defined in
    ``.env``). This affects many things in the application, such as displaying
    stacktraces on error pages or if cache files are dynamically rebuilt on
    each request.  Though not a requirement, debug mode is generally set to
    ``true`` for the ``dev`` and ``test`` environments and ``false`` for the
    ``prod`` environment.

    Internally, the value of the debug mode becomes the ``kernel.debug``
    parameter used inside the :doc:`service container </service_container>`.
    If you look inside the application configuration file, you'll see the
    parameter used, for example, to turn Twig's debug mode on:

    .. configuration-block::

        .. code-block:: yaml

            # config/packages/twig.yaml
            twig:
                debug: '%kernel.debug%'

        .. code-block:: xml

            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
            <container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
                xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                xmlns:doctrine="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/doctrine"
                xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                    http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd
                    http://symfony.com/schema/dic/twig
                    http://symfony.com/schema/dic/twig/twig-1.0.xsd">

                <twig:config debug="%kernel.debug%" />

            </container>

        .. code-block:: php

            $container->loadFromExtension('twig', array(
                'debug' => '%kernel.debug%',
                // ...
            ));

Selecting the Environment for Console Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Symfony commands are executed in whatever environment is defined by
the ``APP_ENV`` environment variable (usually configured in your ``.env`` file).

Use the ``--env`` and ``--no-debug`` options to modify this behavior:

.. code-block:: terminal

    # 'dev' environment and debug enabled
    $ php bin/console command_name

    # 'prod' environment (debug is always disabled for 'prod')
    $ php bin/console command_name --env=prod

    # 'test' environment and debug disabled
    $ php bin/console command_name --env=test --no-debug

   single: Environments; Creating a new environment

Creating a new Environment
--------------------------

Since an environment is nothing more than a string that corresponds to a set of
configuration, creating a new environment is quite easy.

Suppose, for example, that before deployment, you need to benchmark your
application. One way to benchmark the application is to use near-production
settings, but with Symfony's ``web_profiler`` enabled. This allows Symfony
to record information about your application while benchmarking.

The best way to accomplish this is via a new environment called, for example,
``benchmark``. Start by creating a new configuration directory and a
configuration file:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # config/packages/benchmark/web_profiler.yaml
        framework:
            profiler: { only_exceptions: false }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <!-- config/packages/benchmark/web_profiler.xml -->
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns:framework="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony
                http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony/symfony-1.0.xsd">

            <framework:config>
                <framework:profiler only-exceptions="false" />
            </framework:config>

        </container>

    .. code-block:: php

        // config/packages/benchmark/web_profiler.php
        $container->loadFromExtension('framework', array(
            'profiler' => array('only_exceptions' => false),
        ));

And... you're finished! The application now supports a new environment called
``benchmark``.

Change the ``APP_ENV`` variable to ``benchmark`` to be able to access the new
environment through your browser:

.. code-block:: bash

    # .env
    APP_ENV=benchmark

.. sidebar:: Importing configuration

    Besides loading files in the Kernel, you can also import files in the
    configuration directly. For instance, to make sure the benchmark
    environment is identical to the prod environment, you might want to load
    all its configuration as well.

    You can achieve this by using a special ``imports`` key:

    .. configuration-block:

        .. code-block:: yaml

            # config/packages/benchmark/other.yaml
            imports:
                - { resource: '../prod/' }

                # other resources are possible as well, like importing other
                # files or using globs:
                #- { resource: '/etc/myapp/some_special_config.xml' }
                #- { resource: '/etc/myapp/*.yaml' }

        .. code-block:: xml

            <!-- config/packages/benchmark/other.xml -->
            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
            <container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services"
                xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                xmlns:framework="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony"
                xsi:schemaLocation="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services
                    http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd
                    http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony
                    http://symfony.com/schema/dic/symfony/symfony-1.0.xsd">

                <imports>
                    <import resource="../prod/"/>

                    <!-- other resources are possible as well, like importing other
                         files or using globs:
                    <import resource="/etc/myapp/some_special_config.yaml"/>
                    <import resource="/etc/myapp/*.xml"/>
                    -->
                </imports>

            </container>

        .. code-block:: php

            // config/packages/benchmark/other.php
            $loader->import('../prod/');

            // other resources are possible as well, like importing other
            // files or using globs:
            //$loader->import('/etc/myapp/some_special_config.yaml');
            //$loader->import('/etc/myapp/*.php');

   single: Environments; Cache directory

Environments and the Cache Directory
------------------------------------

Symfony takes advantage of caching in many ways: the application configuration,
routing configuration, Twig templates and more are cached to PHP objects
stored in files on the filesystem.

By default, these cached files are largely stored in the ``var/cache/`` directory.
However, each environment caches its own set of files:

.. code-block:: text

    your-project/
    ├─ var/
    │  ├─ cache/
    │  │  ├─ dev/   # cache directory for the *dev* environment
    │  │  └─ prod/  # cache directory for the *prod* environment
    │  ├─ ...

Sometimes, when debugging, it may be helpful to inspect a cached file to
understand how something is working. When doing so, remember to look in
the directory of the environment you're using (most commonly ``dev/`` while
developing and debugging). While it can vary, the ``var/cache/dev/`` directory
includes the following:

``appDevDebugProjectContainer.php``
    The cached "service container" that represents the cached application
    configuration.

``appDevUrlGenerator.php``
    The PHP class generated from the routing configuration and used when
    generating URLs.

``appDevUrlMatcher.php``
    The PHP class used for route matching - look here to see the compiled regular
    expression logic used to match incoming URLs to different routes.

``twig/``
    This directory contains all the cached Twig templates.

.. note::

    You can easily change the directory location and name. For more information
    read the article :doc:`/configuration/override_dir_structure`.
