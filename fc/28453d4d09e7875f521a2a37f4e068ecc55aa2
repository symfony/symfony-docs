This chapter should be moved to the doc of the Debug component, and the page in the ClassLoader component should mention that the class is deprecated as of 2.4 and extends the new DebugClassLoader.

Thanks for your feedback, @stof. I moved the chapter, but left the deprecated one with a note.

What did you mean with `[...] and extends the new DebugClassLoader`?

@xabbuh As the deprecated class extends the new one in the Debug component, using it requires installing the Debug component

Maybe I am totally wrong, but looking at the source code I don't see, how the class from THW Claas Loader component extends the one from the Debug component.

ah sorry, it has been copied, not extended, to keep a full BC. I should have checked before commenting

@xabbuh Can you rebase please? Then I'll get this merged!

@weaverryan Done. Please notice that this needs to be merge into the ``2.4`` branch but not in the master branch.
