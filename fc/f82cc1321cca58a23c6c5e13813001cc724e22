I like updating this to not use mysql. Can you please fix the whitespace issues?

Yes, I am working on it.

As you can see in the diff of this PR, there are still some whitespace issues.

Anyway, we can also fix these while merging the PR, so I'm :+1: for this PR.

Alright. It's my first PR. So what's the next step?

@iqbalmalik89 now this PR can be considered finished, the doc team (@weaverryan, @xabbuh, @javiereguiluz and me) can vote on the PR. After at least 2 team members voted +1 (you have mine already), the PR will be merged.

So unfortunately for you, it'll be a waiting game now.

:+1: this change is in fact an urgent necessity now that `mysql` is deprecated/dead.

@iqbalmalik89 thanks for taking care of this and for this nice pull request.
