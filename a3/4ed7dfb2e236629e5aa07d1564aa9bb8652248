Is there any chance that I can help with merging when the time comes? I wouldn't mind doing it and I really want to see this one get merged.

@kunicmarko20 sorry but that can't happen because only the Doc Team members have permission to merge.

Some of the names have been updated according to comments, some are still waiting for a reply.

I renamed all `$container` to `$containerBuilder` where we have a new instance of `ContainerBuilder` the only place I left it as `$container` is in the examples that show the real code e.g. [the Dependency Injection Extension](https://github.com/symfony/dependency-injection/blob/master/Extension/Extension.php#L80)

@kunicmarko20 please tell me when you think this is ready so I can better prepare for merging this. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz if there is nothing else that needs to be changed on my side, it is ready.
