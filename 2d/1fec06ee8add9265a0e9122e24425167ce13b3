@MichaelDemeyer thanks for contributing to Symfony Docs. Before merging I'd like to get more details about this change: does this fix some issue? Is this better for some reason? Thanks!

Hi, currently this part of documentation tell users to re-run the same command if it failed the first time (screenshot attached).

As far as I know it's safer to run composer update without "--with-all-dependencies" first, and if it failed review the needed dependencies update and make the decision to run (or not run) composer with the "--with-all-dependencies" flag.

Documentation for 3.*  seems to follow this pattern.

Thx.

@MichaelDemeyer thanks for providing these details. You are absolutely right! I was confused because of the `.. include`. This change is coherent with what we do in this other article: https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/upgrade_major.html so let's merge it.

Thanks ... and congrats on your first Symfony Docs contribution! ðŸŽ‰
