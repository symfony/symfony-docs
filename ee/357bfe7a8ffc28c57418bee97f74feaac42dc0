I agree with you, I see no benefit of a custom routing loader.

Some changes in this PR might conflict with #4740. Could you please check that and remove the ones that will conflict?

@WouterJ The file `cookbook/routing/custom_route_loader.rst` is not part of #4740, isn't it?

Indeed, my bad. I thought it changed all cookbook articles.

@xelaris this looks great - nice work! But you're right - the first 2 paragraphs (especially the first) is terrible! I think we should mention FOSRestBundle as we do now, and make a new intro centered around it as one example.

Also, it's out of scope, but I think we should just show the class extending `Loader` in the first example. That's much easier and more powerful. Then we can have a note that says that you can simply implement `LoaderInterface` instead of extending `Loader` if you want.

@xelaris Can you at least take a shot at updating the first paragraph for us?

@weaverryan Thank you for the feedback. I have changed the first two paragraphs and tried to make it more clear.
In addition I have changed the code example to extend from `Loader` as you suggested.

Thanks @xabbuh. I have added filename comments to all the php code blocks.

I don't think anything is missing here. Flagged it with Finished :)
