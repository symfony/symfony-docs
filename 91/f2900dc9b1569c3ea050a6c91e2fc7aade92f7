Is this possible since 6.2? If yes, please add a `versionadded` directive. You can search the repository for examples.

Thanks

It is possible since DoctrineBundle 2.8, I feel like it is before SF 6.2.
But seems to be compliant with 5.4 maybe I need rebase ?

Lets target `6.2` and as this is an "external" attribute, no `versionadded` is needed 👍
