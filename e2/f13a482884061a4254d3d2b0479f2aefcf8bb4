Fyi, I've added `[WCM]` which means Waiting Code Merge to your PR title. This way, we don't merge it when the code isn't merged yet.

Removed the [WCM] tag as the related PR (symfony/symfony#11426) has been merged

You should add a `.. versionadded:: 2.6` directive before the new text, to explain it's new:
````rst
.. versionadded:: 2.6
    The :method;`Symfony\\Component\\DomCrawler\\Crawler::nodeName` was
    introduced in Symfony 2.6.
````

@WouterJ do you reckon there's anything else to be done on this PR or do I need to do anything more? Or is it just waiting for someone who can spare time to merge?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fejese this PR is ready to be merged. When @weaverryan has some time left, he'll merge it asap.

Thanks for your time to add a nice feature and document it perfectly!
