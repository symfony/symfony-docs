There are many occurrences of `setParameter()` in the docs. Also, I see this method defined in the container interface:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/73a6b4b8ad315d294fe18c03012019694863daa9/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/ContainerInterface.php#L71

And in the container implementation:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/73a6b4b8ad315d294fe18c03012019694863daa9/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Container.php#L133-L136

So maybe there's a confusion? Why do you say that this method doesn't exist? Thanks!

That's not the `Container` class being passed to the php configuration closures.

This one is: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/a0fb29ec8b434f3b1cadfb93419d569805891d99/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Loader/Configurator/ContainerConfigurator.php
See the `PhpFileLoader` (particularly the `executeCallback` method):
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/a0fb29ec8b434f3b1cadfb93419d569805891d99/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Loader/PhpFileLoader.php

That being the case I could say that all of the mentions to use the `setParameter` method in the php configuration are if fact incorrect.

How would you like to proceed?
I'd like to merge this one and open the ticket for fixing the others when I or someone else has time to donate

@javiereguiluz the entry doc for configuring symfony has the correct information (just select the PHP format)
https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration.html

how should we proceed?

Yes, it looks like the right class is `Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;` as you said.

So, let's merge this PR and we can fix the others in a different PR. Thanks!
