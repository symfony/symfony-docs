@javiereguiluz I left just one minor comment.

Though unfortunately you need to do another rebase (the `payload` option was lost and the order of the code blocks needs to be fixed).

@xabbuh I've added the `payload` option removed by mistake (I don't know what could I do without your reviews!!! Thanks a lot). And the examples have also been sorted as annotation - yaml -xml - php.

I've fixed all the reported issues. Thanks.

Now for some reason the order of the code blocks in the first example changes again.

@xabbuh sorry for that! Fixed now. Thanks.
