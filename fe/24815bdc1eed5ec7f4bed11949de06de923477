Hi @soyuka! What about changing the code example on line 205 with something like this instead:
```diff
-     $finder->path('some/special/dir');
+     // matches files in the data/ directory and its subdirectories.
+     $finder->path('data');
```

I don't think we should add a whole new paragraph and code example for such information. It can perfectly be included in the code example imo. However, I would like to hear your and others opinions about it. If you agree, can you please update the PR?

Status: needs work

My point is that, `path` method will match the directory containing files too.

Saying:

> matches files in the data/ directory and its subdirectories.

isn't sufficient imo, because it'll also match a `data` file. Or when filtered by `name` it'll match the file if it exists or sub directories.

I agree with @WouterJ but I also understand what @soyuka says. This is really tricky. What about this proposal:

```php
// matches files that contain "data" anywhere in their paths (including filenames)
$finder->path('data');
```

@javiereguiluz +1, but may we add an example that combines `path` and `name`? I think that adding `name` helps to understand the usage finality:

```php
// matches files that contain "data" anywhere in their paths (files or directories)
$finder->path('data');
// for example this will match data/*.xml and data.xml if they exists
$finder->path('data')->name('*.xml');
```

@soyuka  +1 I like your proposal because to me this looks impossible to explain in just 1 sentence.

Actually, after reading your proposal, it's the first time I understand the problem this PR tries to solve. 👍 to update the example with that.

Can you please update your PR?

Github does weird things sorry about that, updated with my last example l205 and removed the previous paragraph.
