Why is the `Code-Blocks` CI check failing? ðŸ¤”

I can't understand the failure either. The FQCN is correct, right?

It is, yes https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6aa60fac88bace3fd7c5b026d95c38bba4ce7259/src/Symfony/Component/Uid/NilUlid.php#L12-L20

@Nyholm can you help us out here?

Excellent question. The CI job [check out](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/5.4/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L152-L154) a Symfony application and try to insert the code example there.

The Symfony application did not have the Uid component installed. I added the component in this PR: https://github.com/symfony-tools/symfony-application/pull/4

I've now merged in the UID component to all 5.2+ branches. If this CI job is restarted it will (hopefully) pass.
