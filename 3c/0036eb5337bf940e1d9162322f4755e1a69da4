@JhonnyL thanks for reporting this issue. Although your solution works, this other solution is also possible:

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
```

And of course, change the typehint from `EntityManager` to `ObjectManager` in the method. What do you think?

and I think the current buggy code comes from a failed attempt at migrating from the ORM-specific typehint to the common interface.

It was changed from ```ObjectManager``` to ```EntityManager``` in https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/5456.

@javiereguiluz @stof It was changed to ```EntityManger``` in a previous commit cause of inconsistency with the variable name.

Typehinting the ```ObjectManger``` is probably better, but then I should also change the variable name to ```$manager```. What do you think?

@JhonnyL to me it makes sense to rename it to `$manager`
