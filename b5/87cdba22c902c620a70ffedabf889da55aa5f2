May be it would be better to add `verify_peer` to the list of options, instead of it having its own section.

Since `components/mailer.rst` got removed, should I may be base this PR off of https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/14083?

@OskarStark I'll wait for https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/14083 to be merged, before I make any changes, since the whole thing needs to be restructured then anyway.
