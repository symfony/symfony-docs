Unfortunately, I won't have time before the end of the week as I am pretty busy currently. Should be fine next week, though! :)

The doc is still outdated ? I have tested with the Ldad class (+factory) and it works well.

Yes, there are a few things still pending to get this PR merged. Unfortunately I am too busy to finalise this in the short term, but if someone wants, he can make a small PR against my fork, or create a new PR based on this one.
