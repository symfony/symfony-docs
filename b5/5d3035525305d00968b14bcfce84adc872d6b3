@xabbuh thank you for the review. I've made changes in a separate commit so you can check only the diff.
Moreover I would like to point out that, for consistency reason, even

```
.. _`FrameworkExtension for 3.3.0`: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7938fdeceb03cc1df277a249cf3da70f0b50eb98/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/DependencyInjection/FrameworkExtension.php#L247-L284
```

should be converted to `:doc:` reference.

WDYT?

The `doc` role does not work for external links (for example, to link to code on GitHub). We can only use it for cross-references inside this documentation.

Right, didn't see that was an external link.

At the end will you squash commits or do you prefer me to do the squash?

Whatever you prefer :) As long as you do not push a merge commit we can easily squash your commits while merging.

Ok, I have no preferences, just let me know if I need to perform other actions on this.
