@chalasr what do you think about example how to register command handlers for this command bus with tags? I think it will be a very common case for this feature.

@unkind Sounds good, though I think we try to keep sections "standalone" as possible, so maybe not a concrete example but a simple mention saying that tags can be useful in this case and a link to the corresponding doc (working with tagged services).

Status: needs work

(the core PR has been updated, now using the new custom tags feature).

I will add a second alternative to the first (bad) example: injecting the container.

This may have just changed due to symfony/symfony#22024

Finally took the time to finish this. Ready to review!
