Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.4, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2.

Cheers!

Uh should I really rebase it on 5.4? The documentation (and PR placeholder) says

> If you are […] documenting a new feature, switch to the first Symfony version that included it.

:thinking:

@OskarStark thanks for the review :pray:

I changed things a little further; I hope it’s okay.
