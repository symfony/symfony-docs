I am really sorry that we missed to review your pull request for such a long time @mheki! This looks really great and I just left you some minor comments.

Thanks for the review @xabbuh @WouterJ I've changed the docs according to your suggestions.
Could you take a look again please?

Looks great, thanks for submitting the docs and your quick response @mheki! :+1:

I think we should add a ``.. versionadded::`` directive indicating Guard was added in 2.8 directly after the headline, but we can add this after the merge.

Hmmm... I've just seen your commit `Removed all 2.x versionadded directives` made couple days ago...

@mheki yeah, for the 3.0 + master branch. I think it still makes sense for the 2.8 branch.
