I see an issue with this proposal: the composer global project can contain lots of other stuff as well, which might create issues in your project. To do it in a safe way, you should do a composer installation where you only have the var-dumper component

@stof that's exactly what I was thinking. Or maybe we have to recommend to add `$HOME/.composer/vendor/symfony/var-dumper/Resources/functions/dump.php` as auto prepend file.

(or create a custom auto prepend file in the PHP dir which requires this one)

@stof lets document an easy way for new comers. Advanced users that know what they do with composer will find their way. New comers won't have many "composer global" things (it's not a very common thing, or you're an advanced user).
This just works (c)

For the reader wondering about autoloading precedence, global classes are always looked up *after* project classes. So, the project always takes precedence.

Absolutely awesome, I've just installed it and it works like a charm, this is REALLY great ! :)

@nicolas-grekas how did you know that I was wondering about autoloading precedence? :) Because of that, I like this.

Thanks!
