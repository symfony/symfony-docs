@javiereguiluz In #6453 you said that the explanation comes too early. But here it is even more to the top of the document. Is that intended?

@xabbuh you are right. I got confused ðŸ˜•  The problem is that I couldn't find a place where all the base controller shortcuts are explained. I'll let you decide what to do with this and the other PR.

:-1: on this place. https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/6453 placed it next to the other sections about Controller response shortcut methods, which seems a better position to me.

OK, here it's a new proposal: I've moved the explanation to the same location as #6453 and simplified everything.

I think we have to document the encoding implementation a bit. This should mostly linking to the Serializer docs and describe that if `framework.serializer` is not enabled in `config.yml`, it'll simply use `json_encode()`.

@WouterJ I've added a note about how are contents encoded. Thanks!
