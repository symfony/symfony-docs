The Front Controller
====================

Up until now, our application is simplistic as there is only one page. To
spice things up a little bit, let's go crazy and add another page that says
goodbye::

    // framework/bye.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();

    $response = new Response('Goodbye!');
    $response->send();

As you can see for yourself, much of the code is exactly the same as the one
we have written for the first page. Let's extract the common code that we can
share between all our pages. Code sharing sounds like a good plan to create
our first "real" framework!

The PHP way of doing the refactoring would probably be the creation of an
include file::

    // framework/init.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();
    $response = new Response();

Let's see it in action::

    // framework/index.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/init.php';

    $name = $request->get('name', 'World');

    $response->setContent(sprintf('Hello %s', htmlspecialchars($name, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')));
    $response->send();

And for the "Goodbye" page::

    // framework/bye.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/init.php';

    $response->setContent('Goodbye!');
    $response->send();

We have indeed moved most of the shared code into a central place, but it does
not feel like a good abstraction, does it? We still have the ``send()`` method
for all pages, our pages do not look like templates and we are still not able
to test this code properly.

Moreover, adding a new page means that we need to create a new PHP script,
which name is exposed to the end user via the URL
(``http://127.0.0.1:4321/bye.php``): there is a direct mapping between the PHP
script name and the client URL. This is because the dispatching of the request
is done by the web server directly. It might be a good idea to move this
dispatching to our code for better flexibility. This can be achieved by routing
all client requests to a single PHP script.

.. tip::

    Exposing a single PHP script to the end user is a design pattern called
    the ":ref:`front controller <from_flat_php-front-controller>`".

Such a script might look like the following::

    // framework/front.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();
    $response = new Response();

    $map = [
        '/hello' => __DIR__.'/hello.php',
        '/bye'   => __DIR__.'/bye.php',
    ];

    $path = $request->getPathInfo();
    if (isset($map[$path])) {
        require $map[$path];
    } else {
        $response->setStatusCode(404);
        $response->setContent('Not Found');
    }

    $response->send();

And here is for instance the new ``hello.php`` script::

    // framework/hello.php
    $name = $request->get('name', 'World');
    $response->setContent(sprintf('Hello %s', htmlspecialchars($name, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')));

In the ``front.php`` script, ``$map`` associates URL paths with their
corresponding PHP script paths.

As a bonus, if the client asks for a path that is not defined in the URL map,
we return a custom 404 page; you are now in control of your website.

To access a page, you must now use the ``front.php`` script:

* ``http://127.0.0.1:4321/front.php/hello?name=Fabien``

* ``http://127.0.0.1:4321/front.php/bye``

``/hello`` and ``/bye`` are the page *paths*.

.. tip::

    Most web servers like Apache or nginx are able to rewrite the incoming URLs
    and remove the front controller script so that your users will be able to
    type ``http://127.0.0.1:4321/hello?name=Fabien``, which looks much better.

The trick is the usage of the ``Request::getPathInfo()`` method which returns
the path of the Request by removing the front controller script name including
its sub-directories (only if needed -- see above tip).

.. tip::

    You don't even need to setup a web server to test the code. Instead,
    replace the ``$request = Request::createFromGlobals();`` call to something
    like ``$request = Request::create('/hello?name=Fabien');`` where the
    argument is the URL path you want to simulate.

Now that the web server always access the same script (``front.php``) for all
pages, we can secure the code further by moving all other PHP files outside the
web root directory:

.. code-block:: text

    example.com
    ├── composer.json
    ├── composer.lock
    ├── src
    │   └── pages
    │       ├── hello.php
    │       └── bye.php
    ├── vendor
    │   └── autoload.php
    └── web
        └── front.php

Now, configure your web server root directory to point to ``web/`` and all
other files won't be accessible from the client anymore.

To test your changes in a browser (``http://localhost:4321/hello?name=Fabien``),
run the :doc:`Symfony Local Web Server </setup/symfony_server>`:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ symfony server:start --port=4321 --passthru=front.php

.. note::

    For this new structure to work, you will have to adjust some paths in
    various PHP files; the changes are left as an exercise for the reader.

The last thing that is repeated in each page is the call to ``setContent()``.
We can convert all pages to "templates" by just echoing the content and calling
the ``setContent()`` directly from the front controller script::

    // example.com/web/front.php

    // ...

    $path = $request->getPathInfo();
    if (isset($map[$path])) {
        ob_start();
        include $map[$path];
        $response->setContent(ob_get_clean());
    } else {
        $response->setStatusCode(404);
        $response->setContent('Not Found');
    }

    // ...

And the ``hello.php`` script can now be converted to a template::

    <!-- example.com/src/pages/hello.php -->
    <?php $name = $request->get('name', 'World') ?>

    Hello <?= htmlspecialchars($name, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') ?>

We have the first version of our framework::

    // example.com/web/front.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();
    $response = new Response();

    $map = [
        '/hello' => __DIR__.'/../src/pages/hello.php',
        '/bye'   => __DIR__.'/../src/pages/bye.php',
    ];

    $path = $request->getPathInfo();
    if (isset($map[$path])) {
        ob_start();
        include $map[$path];
        $response->setContent(ob_get_clean());
    } else {
        $response->setStatusCode(404);
        $response->setContent('Not Found');
    }

    $response->send();

Adding a new page is a two-step process: add an entry in the map and create a
PHP template in ``src/pages/``. From a template, get the Request data via the
``$request`` variable and tweak the Response headers via the ``$response``
variable.

.. note::

    If you decide to stop here, you can probably enhance your framework by
    extracting the URL map to a configuration file.
