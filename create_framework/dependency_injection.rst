The DependencyInjection Component
=================================

In the previous chapter, we emptied the ``Simplex\Framework`` class by
extending the ``HttpKernel`` class from the eponymous component. Seeing this
empty class, you might be tempted to move some code from the front controller
to it::

    // example.com/src/Simplex/Framework.php
    namespace Simplex;

    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher;
    use Symfony\Component\Routing;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel;

    class Framework extends HttpKernel\HttpKernel
    {
        public function __construct($routes)
        {
            $context = new Routing\RequestContext();
            $matcher = new Routing\Matcher\UrlMatcher($routes, $context);

            $controllerResolver = new HttpKernel\Controller\ControllerResolver();
            $argumentResolver = new HttpKernel\Controller\ArgumentResolver();

            $dispatcher = new EventDispatcher();
            $dispatcher->addSubscriber(new HttpKernel\EventListener\RouterListener($matcher));
            $dispatcher->addSubscriber(new HttpKernel\EventListener\ResponseListener('UTF-8'));

            parent::__construct($dispatcher, $controllerResolver, new RequestStack(), $argumentResolver);
        }
    }

The front controller code would become more concise::

    // example.com/web/front.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();
    $routes = include __DIR__.'/../src/app.php';

    $framework = new Simplex\Framework($routes);

    $framework->handle($request)->send();

Having a concise front controller allows you to have several front controllers
for a single application. Why would it be useful? To allow having different
configuration for the development environment and the production one for
instance. In the development environment, you might want to have error
reporting turned on and errors displayed in the browser to ease debugging::

    ini_set('display_errors', 1);
    error_reporting(-1);

... but you certainly won't want that same configuration on the production
environment. Having two different front controllers gives you the opportunity
to have a slightly different configuration for each of them.

So, moving code from the front controller to the framework class makes our
framework more configurable, but at the same time, it introduces a lot of
issues:

* We are not able to register custom listeners anymore as the dispatcher is
  not available outside the Framework class (an easy workaround could be the
  adding of a ``Framework::getEventDispatcher()`` method);

* We have lost the flexibility we had before; you cannot change the
  implementation of the ``UrlMatcher`` or of the ``ControllerResolver``
  anymore;

* Related to the previous point, we cannot test our framework easily anymore
  as it's impossible to mock internal objects;

* We cannot change the charset passed to ``ResponseListener`` anymore (a
  workaround could be to pass it as a constructor argument).

The previous code did not exhibit the same issues because we used dependency
injection; all dependencies of our objects were injected into their
constructors (for instance, the event dispatchers were injected into the
framework so that we had total control of its creation and configuration).

Does it mean that we have to make a choice between flexibility, customization,
ease of testing and not to copy and paste the same code into each application
front controller? As you might expect, there is a solution. We can solve all
these issues and some more by using the Symfony dependency injection
container:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/dependency-injection

Create a new file to host the dependency injection container configuration::

    // example.com/src/container.php
    use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection;
    use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Reference;

    $sc = new DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder();
    $sc->register('context', 'Symfony\Component\Routing\RequestContext');
    $sc->register('matcher', 'Symfony\Component\Routing\Matcher\UrlMatcher')
        ->setArguments(array($routes, new Reference('context')))
    ;
    $sc->register('request_stack', 'Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RequestStack');
    $sc->register('controller_resolver', 'Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Controller\ControllerResolver');
    $sc->register('argument_resolver', 'Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Controller\ArgumentResolver');

    $sc->register('listener.router', 'Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\EventListener\RouterListener')
        ->setArguments(array(new Reference('matcher'), new Reference('request_stack')))
    ;
    $sc->register('listener.response', 'Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\EventListener\ResponseListener')
        ->setArguments(array('UTF-8'))
    ;
    $sc->register('listener.exception', 'Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\EventListener\ExceptionListener')
        ->setArguments(array('Calendar\\Controller\\ErrorController::exceptionAction'))
    ;
    $sc->register('dispatcher', 'Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher')
        ->addMethodCall('addSubscriber', array(new Reference('listener.router')))
        ->addMethodCall('addSubscriber', array(new Reference('listener.response')))
        ->addMethodCall('addSubscriber', array(new Reference('listener.exception')))
    ;
    $sc->register('framework', 'Simplex\Framework')
        ->setArguments(array(
            new Reference('dispatcher'),
            new Reference('controller_resolver'),
            new Reference('request_stack'),
            new Reference('argument_resolver'),
        ))
    ;

    return $sc;

The goal of this file is to configure your objects and their dependencies.
Nothing is instantiated during this configuration step. This is purely a
static description of the objects you need to manipulate and how to create
them. Objects will be created on-demand when you access them from the
container or when the container needs them to create other objects.

For instance, to create the router listener, we tell Symfony that its class
name is ``Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\EventListener\RouterListener`` and
that its constructor takes a matcher object (``new Reference('matcher')``). As
you can see, each object is referenced by a name, a string that uniquely
identifies each object. The name allows us to get an object and to reference
it in other object definitions.

.. note::

    By default, every time you get an object from the container, it returns
    the exact same instance. That's because a container manages your "global"
    objects.

The front controller is now only about wiring everything together::

    // example.com/web/front.php
    require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

    use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

    $routes = include __DIR__.'/../src/app.php';
    $sc = include __DIR__.'/../src/container.php';

    $request = Request::createFromGlobals();

    $response = $sc->get('framework')->handle($request);

    $response->send();

As all the objects are now created in the dependency injection container, the
framework code should be the previous simple version::

    // example.com/src/Simplex/Framework.php
    namespace Simplex;

    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernel;

    class Framework extends HttpKernel
    {
    }

.. note::

    If you want a light alternative for your container, consider `Pimple`_, a
    simple dependency injection container in about 60 lines of PHP code.

Now, here is how you can register a custom listener in the front controller::

    $sc->register('listener.string_response', 'Simplex\StringResponseListener');
    $sc->getDefinition('dispatcher')
        ->addMethodCall('addSubscriber', array(new Reference('listener.string_response')))
    ;

Beside describing your objects, the dependency injection container can also be
configured via parameters. Let's create one that defines if we are in debug
mode or not::

    $sc->setParameter('debug', true);

    echo $sc->getParameter('debug');

These parameters can be used when defining object definitions. Let's make the
charset configurable::

    $sc->register('listener.response', 'Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\EventListener\ResponseListener')
        ->setArguments(array('%charset%'))
    ;

After this change, you must set the charset before using the response listener
object::

    $sc->setParameter('charset', 'UTF-8');

Instead of relying on the convention that the routes are defined by the
``$routes`` variables, let's use a parameter again::

    $sc->register('matcher', 'Symfony\Component\Routing\Matcher\UrlMatcher')
        ->setArguments(array('%routes%', new Reference('context')))
    ;

And the related change in the front controller::

    $sc->setParameter('routes', include __DIR__.'/../src/app.php');

We have obviously barely scratched the surface of what you can do with the
container: from class names as parameters, to overriding existing object
definitions, from shared service support to dumping a container to a plain PHP class,
and much more. The Symfony dependency injection container is really powerful
and is able to manage any kind of PHP class.

Don't yell at me if you don't want to use a dependency injection container in
your framework. If you don't like it, don't use it. It's your framework, not
mine.

This is (already) the last chapter of this book on creating a framework on top
of the Symfony components. I'm aware that many topics have not been covered
in great details, but hopefully it gives you enough information to get started
on your own and to better understand how the Symfony framework works
internally.

If you want to learn more, read the source code of the `Silex`_
micro-framework, and especially its `Application`_ class.

Have fun!
