> So I think our code examples should always base on the lower bound of Symfony's PHP requirements, which at this moment is 7.2.5 for Symfony 5.2.

That would likely mean we cannot switch the code examples to attributes before Symfony 7.0 in 2023. I'm rolling back the examples in question, but we might want to reconsider this rule in a year or so.

Yeah, and maybe the other doc team members have another opinion than me :). Btw, I think it's also good to consider PHP 8 as lower bound for Symfony 6, given that it does bring significant new features (like attributes) and is released a year before Symfony 6.0.
