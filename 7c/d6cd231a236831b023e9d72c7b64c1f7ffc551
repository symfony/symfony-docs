Thank you for fixing this typo @SpacePossum. However, it looks like this is not present in any of the maintained branches (which are `2.7`, `2.8`, `3.4`, `4.0`, `4.1`, and `master`). Thus, I unfortunately need to close here.

Oh indeed, you are absolutely right. Sorry, I totally missed that . We'll merge it into the `2.7` branch.
