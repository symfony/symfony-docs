I just added a commit that (I think) improves this situation, I think we should look at it before merging this. See https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21228#issuecomment-272689414.
I was afraid that changing this behavior would give a lot of drawbacks, I'm sorry about that.

I'm putting this PR on hold because the genius @chalasr has managed to solve this issue. See https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21228

@javiereguiluz fixed on master only due to the potential too much important impact, this stays correct for older branches.
