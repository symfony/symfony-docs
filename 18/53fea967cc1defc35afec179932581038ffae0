@umpirsky What do you think about a quick sentence after the code block?

>
If this doesn't work, try adding a `-n` flag to each command

Then we can merge, even without totally understanding what is right :)

@weaverryan Hehum, I don't like writing about things I don't understand, but done. :)

Thanks @umpirsky :). Actually, what do you think about just having a note about adding `-n` without the second code block? This section is already long, I want to be clear, but keep things somewhat short.

Can can you rebase against the 2.3 branch - e.g. `git rebase master --onto 2.3`? That'll help me patch this cleanly onto the 2.3 branch (no need to actually open a new PR against 2.3).

Cheers!

@weaverryan Fixed. Sorry for the delay.

@umpirsky Can you please rename the ``APACHEUSER`` to ``HTTPDUSER``. We made that change recently.

@xabbuh Fixed, thanks.
