@loonytoons Thank you for the fixes. Do you like to open a separate pull request for the semicolons so that they can be merged into the `2.3` branch?

@xabbuh Added in PR #4523. Is it okay to leave them in this PR, or did you want them taken out of here?

I think it's okay to keep them here.

@WouterJ Is the merge to capable to handle this?
