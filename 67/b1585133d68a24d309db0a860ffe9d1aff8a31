@dompie thanks for this contribution! However, `3.2` branch is not maintained anymore. Here you have the list of maintained branches: https://symfony.com/roadmap#maintained-symfony-branches  You probably want to target 3.4 branch.

@lyrixx could you please review if updating this image is OK? Thanks!
