Hi @Nyholm

I refer to the available documentation for the component since it's release. It changed 3 times until getting into the current state:
4.1: The parameter is just `$handler`
https://symfony.com/doc/4.1/components/messenger.html#bus
4.2: The parameter is an array with named keys: `['dummy' => $handler]`
https://symfony.com/doc/4.2/components/messenger.html#bus
4.3 onwards: The parameter is an array without keys: `[$handler]`
https://symfony.com/doc/4.3/components/messenger.html#bus

I don know what we want to do to document this. If needed I can go and make PRs aiming each of the versions and document `$handler` on each of them.

Answering your question about $handler: I considered adding a comment "see next item" or something similar when declaring the `$handler` and this is also why I choose not to do it inline inside the MessageBus creation.

Let me know how you want me to proceed with this PR, I am happy with any decision made about the comments and the number of PRs needed to close the issue.

Excellent question.

The docs team is super of moving changes to different branches. I know that this will be merged in master and "copied" down to 5.0 and 4.4.

We dont bother about 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 since those versions are not maintained anymore.

>  considered adding a comment "see next item

I think the current solution is fine for now.

-------

I think this PR is ready for merge. @jpjoao thank you for this. No more changes is needed at the moment.

👍
