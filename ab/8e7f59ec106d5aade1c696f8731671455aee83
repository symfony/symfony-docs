Thank you for noticing and for providing a patch @dangarzon. As you have seen, simply using the documents title is a bit error prone when the referenced document's title changes. Therefore, I would suggest to simply omit the title here and let Sphinx do all the work for us.

@xabbuh
Done, link modified without title

@dangarzon Thank you. Can you even reorder the paragraph so that uses almost all available space of a line (simply wrap lines after the first word that crosses the 72nd character).
