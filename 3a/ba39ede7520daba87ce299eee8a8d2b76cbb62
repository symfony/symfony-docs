Thanks for taking care of these important changes!

I'd add the same comment as in https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/15157#issuecomment-808721361. I think we should add a comment about how "main " was called "master" in previous Symfony versions. It's not needed to add this in all places mentioning "main requests", but maybe just in the most important article explaining this. Thanks!
