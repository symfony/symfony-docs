Hi @xabbuh, thanks for the review :)

Thinking about it, is it a good place to add a note about validation groups?

Something like:

> If you need to apply multiple sets of rules using the same form type, use validation groups.

With a minimal example attached to this note: WDYT?

I think it would probably be better to put it the other way around:

> If your form requires only a subset of all the configured validation constraints, [...]

And then just link this paragraph to the article about validation groups.

@mickaelandrieu I liked both your original proposal and the reword suggestions made by @xabbuh so I reworded this accordingly. What do you think? Thanks!

@javiereguiluz you have improved my proposal as always!

Thank you :+1:

Edit: so we don't add a note about validation groups?
