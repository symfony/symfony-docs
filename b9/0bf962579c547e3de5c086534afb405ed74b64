I don't see any differences between symfony.com and the platform.sh build, but :+1: anyway it makes sense.

I don't understand this change. I think we always use the double quotes for YAML strings.

@WouterJ @javiereguiluz You have to look at the `2.3` branch on symfony.com. I did not merge branches up as I wanted to fix this first.

@javiereguiluz double quotes means escape sequences in Yaml. So `\.` is seen as an escape sequence instead of `\.` as a string. Single quotes don't use escape sequences in Yaml, so `\.` is seen as the string `\.`, exactly what we want.

@WouterJ thanks for the explanation. I understand it now :)  Would it make sense to change all double quotes by single quotes then?
