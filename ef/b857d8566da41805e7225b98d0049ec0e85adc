What is the reason for this change? (the title says "fix", but I don't think it changed the meaning of the existing text?)

To me, this is too much implementation detail for the documentation. It combines many topics that might be unknown to the reader in a single paragraph, which distracts from the actual usage part of this trait.

It fixes the documentation because to use `$clock` provided by the trait, you don't have to add a type-hinted property to the constructor like it was written. When you use the trait, everything's done thanks to `#[Required]` attribute above trait's `setClock()`. This PR aims to fix this part.

Do you see it somewhere else, like in a dedicated page for example? üôÇ It's true now that the component has all these different features, it may be a good idea to split this in separate pages like it is for [the Console component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html#sln)?

Ah, sorry. I was too quick, makes sense üëç but let's make the paragraph a bit simpler (I'll propose something after this comment).

> Do you see it somewhere else, like in a dedicated page for example?

No, I meant that we now mention quite some unrelated concepts like "`#[Required]` attribute" and "service autoconfiguration". As these are somewhat advanced terms, they can distract people from what we actually try to explain to them: how to use the `ClockAwareTrait`. While writing documentation, it's often good to leave out as much implementation details as possible. If someone wants to know how a feature works, they can have a look in the code.

We are actually doing the opposite the past years: move all separate articles into single guides. We've discovered that it's much easier for readers if all information about a single topic is on a single page (especially now that the docs have a sticky table of contents)

Thank you for your explanations @wouterj! It's definitely clearer now and I totally prefer your version without superfluous technical details. I'll keep this in mind in future contributions.

The "single page documentation" way to do is also very good to know. I agree that everything in one page makes the info research easier. I'll actually apply this in the followup PR regarding Nicolas' comment https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/17771#pullrequestreview-1254034932.

Thanks for the time you spent on that feedback üëç
