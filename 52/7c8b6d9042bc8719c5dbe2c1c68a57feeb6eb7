Could you please add the [PR format](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/documentation/overview.html#pull-request-format) to your PR description?

Great thanks! I made the fixes, even I'm afraid I did not fully figure out the meaning of the PR Format's lines Doc fix / New docs.

``Doc fix`` means fixing existing doc (typos, wrong explanation, ...). ``New doc`` means you are documented a new feature ("new" being related to what the doc contains, not to the fact that the code was just merged or is available but undocumented since 2 years)

Hey Ville!

This is a great missing piece of documentation to cover - thanks for opening the PR! There are just a few comments remaining - can you make those tweaks?

Thanks!

Yes, they are now fixed!
