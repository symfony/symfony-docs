I prefer not to add more commits to this PR to avoid getting too big. If you agree with the changes/fixes, please merge it.

Do far, I think it looks fine. Besides, you could squash your commits if you feel that they get somewhat messy.

Did you test all lists that were changed to #. in this PR? That syntax can be buggy sometimes

@WouterJ yes, I checked the three lists. I even checked them with the GitHub renderer and everything seems fine.
