This change looks good to me. But I think we should add a `versionadded` directive which explains that support for this parameter was introduced in 3.2.

Thanks for the review @xabbuh, I added `versionadded`.

@javiereguiluz I updated the `versionadded` part. What do you think of the comment of stof? Should I add a new section near `Generating URLs with Query Strings`? Thanks.
