Ryan, I thought about that ... but the File form field doesn't have an `accept` option (it's an HTML attribute defined via `attr`) so it's really hard to mention this feature there ðŸ˜•

@OskarStark do you know why this is failing?

```
Warning, treated as error:

/home/travis/build/symfony/symfony-docs/reference/constraints/File.rst:251:
WARNING: undefined label: forms-field-guessing (if the link has no caption the
label must precede a section header)
```

The reference exists and I think the syntax is correct. Thanks.

@javiereguiluz Are you sure? I cannot find the reference.

It's strange. On my local computer I see this in the main `forms.rst` file:

But in the repository the reference is different: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/symfony/symfony-docs/4.4/forms.rst

```
.. _form-type-guessing:
```

OK, I've just rebased this PR to the latest 4.4 changes, so it should be OK now. Thanks.
