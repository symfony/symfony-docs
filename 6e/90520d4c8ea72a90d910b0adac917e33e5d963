I guess this is actually not possible with XML since you can't set an attribute multiple times.

This should work:

````xml
<monolog:config>
    <monolog:handler name="swift" ...>
        <monolog:to-email>dev1@example.com</monolog:to-email>
        <monolog:to-email>dev2@example.com</monolog:to-email>
    </monolog:handler>
</monolog:config>
````

(iirc, the XML parser doesn't parse elements or attributes differently, you can replace all attributes by elements)

@WouterJ The issue is that the MonologBundle XML schema doesn't allow ``to-email`` elements: https://github.com/symfony/MonologBundle/blob/master/Resources/config/schema/monolog-1.0.xsd#L18-28

@xabbuh then someone should fix that. If we don't put the scheme in schemeLocation, it'll not be validated and work perfectly

@WouterJ I'm preparing a pull request on the MonologBundle.

see symfony/MonologBundle#91

Nice work @xabbuh! I think we should merge this and then update the docs later after that code PR is merged. Make sense?

@weaverryan I'm fine with that. We can update the XML example once the pull request on the MonologBundle is merged.
