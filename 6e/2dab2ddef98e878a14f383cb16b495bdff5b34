@javiereguiluz the next question is whether we should actually document the usage of custom scopes (IIRC, we discussed removing the request scope in 3.0 as the RequestContext is the proper way to handle this, and then the question is whether we actually need scopes)

@stof I propose to wait until a decision has been made about the future of scopes.
