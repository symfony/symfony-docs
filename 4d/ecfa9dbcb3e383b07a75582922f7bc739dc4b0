Any feedback on this one? @weaverryan? @javiereguiluz?

@theofidry the contributed doc is nice. Thanks!

The only thing I miss is a cool feature that @nicolas-grekas told me about: you can use a number as the value of `SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER`. Why? @WouterJ explains it well in this StackOverfow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35377529/problems-using-symfony2-phpunit/35378446#35378446

Indeed quite a nice feature. I will address your comments shortly, thanks for the review :)

I updated most the PR to address the comments, my apologies if I forgot one

Cool, thanks for your work on this one! You seem to have misunderstood/forgotten 2 minor things, but we can fix those during the merge as well. :+1: from me!

updated:

* Added a link for the `@ operator`
* Dropped the `Component` part in the name as it's a bridge and not a component
* Added doc for the `ClockMock`

It looks great! Thanks for your quick response.

Oh gosh I hate when GitHub collapses all comments even if they are know. Sorry I cannot find where you putted your comment:

>Yeah, we can maybe skip it in the introduction. It's usefull to know what it does, but you already mentioned that just below this summary.

Maybe I've just changed the intro to not mention `ClockMock`. I still like the idea of the intro rather than the bullet point list as the bullet point list already gives a fairly detailed list of the features, whereas the intro stays more vague and gives a bigger picture of what the bridge does.

@theofidry thanks for writing this doc. I used it to write this blog post: http://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-2-8-clock-mocking-and-time-sensitive-tests

The blog post was reviewed by Nicolas, so I'm afraid that the current pull request has some errors about how to enable/disable the clock mocking explicitly. In addition, we could mention the fact that clock mocking makes your tests execute much faster (because time passes instantly).

by theofidry at 2016-02-29T14:55:52Z

@javiereguiluz then I guess what is left is update the clock mocking part with your blog post ;) I will try to do that tonight but can't guarantee anything.

Updated :)
