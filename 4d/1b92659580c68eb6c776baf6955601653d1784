@nicolas-grekas my bad, didnt thank you have started something... as you like, I wont be sad if you close this one, my only interest is to see this feature documented ^^

By the way, big thanks! From a business/e-commerce point of view, this feature is so useful :)

@mickaelandrieu I left two last minor comments and indentation of the PHP code examples looks weird too. But overall this change looks ready to be merged. üëç
