Can we guarantee that the snippet is never modified by someone else?

Yes, if someone modifies it, it'll create a new fork (so another url) or a new version (so another url too)

Do you get notifications in case someone modifies it?

No and it shouldn't make any sense to get those imo

This means that we have to check the example frequently, doesn't it?

Why? *"if someone modifies it, it'll create a new fork (so another url) or a new version (so another url too)"*

Sorry, I read "I'll" and not "it'll".
