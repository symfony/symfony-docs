Should I add examples for every assertion? To me they all seem self-explanatory, but I could be more exhaustive with examples üòÑ

Also, to reference this page in a better way in the docs (so it can be easily accessible), I may need some advices and tips on where I could add links to this new page üëç

Hey Alex, thank you for this nice new feature and the documentation so far.

To be honest I am not sure if replacing the explicit example with the shortcuts is the right way.
I think the user should what is done internally. An idea could be to write it that way:
```php
    $this->assertGreaterThan(
        0,
        $crawler->filter('html:contains("Hello World")')->count()
    );

    // or use a shortcut
    $this->assertSelectorTextContains('html', 'Hello World');
```

Not sure we should add so many `versionadded` directive (I mean for every new method one). I am for grouping them under a sub-headline. and add only one `versionadded`.

What do you think @symfony/team-symfony-docs ?

I fixed many of your reviews, and I think we should also plan to make the assertions compatible with Panther for more flexibility üëç

About the Panther compatibility, I think we should update Panther itself first, because of [these lines](https://github.com/symfony/panther/blob/dbbb80b844e5cf9ca22ec9acd68168187bd6f560/src/Client.php#L86-L94) throwing an exception on `getRequest()` and `getResponse()`.
