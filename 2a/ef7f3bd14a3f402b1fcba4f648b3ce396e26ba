Not sure about these changes ðŸ˜•  We use a special title case on purpose. I know it's confusing some times (see https://writing.stackexchange.com/a/4622) but we can't change it now that all docs use it.

So please, revert all changes in titles. Thanks!

OK, there you go :-) BTW: Capitalization was *inconsistent* before.
