I think it's too early to remove annotations ... but we should add attributes in addition to annotations to all examples. See for example https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html#matching-http-methods

But, before doing any change, let's ask to @symfony/team-symfony-docs

I am üëç on your comment @javiereguiluz! Indeed, annotations are being replaced by attributes but I didn't see some "official" deprecation about annotations for the moment (and we won't see any before PHP 8 becomes the lowest supported version I guess!). In any case I'll be happy to make the change if needed!
