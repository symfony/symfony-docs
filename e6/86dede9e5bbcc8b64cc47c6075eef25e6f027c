@zanbaldwin thanks for providing these docs. They read nicely and we'll merge them when the related code is merged.

A minor comment about the content: we don't mention in the normal text the Symfony version in which features were introduced. Instead, we document the feature without mentioning the version and we add a `.. versionadded:: x.y` directive.

For this specific pull request we should make two changes:

1) Remove *"Starting from Symfony 4.3 .."* from the normal paragraphs.
2) Include the following at the end of the section that explains the new feature:

```rst
.. versionadded:: 4.3

    Invokable configurators for services were introduced in Symfony 4.3.
```

The ending (*"... were introduced in Symfony 4.3."*) is standard for all `versionadded` directives, but you can reword the first part if you want.

If you need any help or have any question about this, please ask. Thanks.
