But this is intended, because is considered a best practice. http://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/forms.html

> We recommend using $form->isSubmitted() in the if statement for clarity. This isn't technically needed, since isValid() first calls isSubmitted(). But without this, the flow doesn't read well as it looks like the form is always processed (even on the GET request).

Okay ... but then this should be changed in the referenced documentation http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html#handling-form-submissions, shouldn't it?

Yes, you're right. If you can do it would be great!
