How to Use advanced ACL Concepts
================================

.. caution::

    ACL support was removed in Symfony 4.0. Install the `Symfony ACL bundle`_
    and refer to its documentation if you want to keep using ACL.

    Alternatively, consider using :doc:`security voters </security/voters>`,
    the alternative to ACLs recommended by Symfony.
