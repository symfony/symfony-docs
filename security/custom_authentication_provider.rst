How to Create a custom Authentication Provider
==============================================

Creating a custom authentication system is hard, and this entry will walk
you through that process. But depending on your needs, you may be able
to solve your problem in a simpler manner, or via a community bundle:

* :doc:`/security/guard_authentication`
* :doc:`/security/custom_password_authenticator`
* :doc:`/security/api_key_authentication`
* To authenticate via OAuth using a third-party service such as Google, Facebook
  or Twitter, try using the `HWIOAuthBundle`_ community bundle.
