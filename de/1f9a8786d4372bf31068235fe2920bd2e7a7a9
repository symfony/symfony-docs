Ping @weaverryan if you can, please review this. I'm not sure my wording is perfectly clear here. Thanks a lot!

I think you miss the latest change about „failover()“ and „roundrobin()“ here, which was merged in another PR yesterday? Today?

@OskarStark you are right ... but that change was made in 4.4 (as a BC break, but that's OK because it's still experimental). This one improves the explanation from 4.3, which is when this was introduced.

You are right 👍🏻
