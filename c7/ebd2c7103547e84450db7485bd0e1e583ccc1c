:+1:

(there are 2 minor spacing issues: one space too much before `)` and one new line too much at the end of the file, but we'll take care of these issues while merging).

Do we really want to dismiss Capifony? Why don't we promote both?

@xabbuh http://williamdurand.fr/2015/04/11/on-capifony-and-its-future/ suggests that Capifony is there only for backwards compability and new projects should use either Capistrano v3 or other tools (like Docker). As this message is written by the maintainers of Capifony, I think it's better to no longer mention it (and btw, there still is a mention of Capifony).
