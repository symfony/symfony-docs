PS: Also should it be **an HTTP** or **a HTTP**? As far as my English knowledge goes **an** is needed when the next word starts with a vowel. Asking because **an HTTP** sounds very strange when reading and when I don't like how something sounds it quite often isn't right.

It's "an HTTP" because of how the "H" is pronounced.
