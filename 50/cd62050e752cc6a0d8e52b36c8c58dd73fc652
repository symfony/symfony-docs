What do you think about reusing the description that we already have for the [widget option](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types/date.html#widget) of the `date` type (as it is basically the same)?

Sure, that sounds even better.

@XitasoChris Will you be able to do the change? I think this would be ready to be merged then.

@xabbuh Should I just copy it or move it to a new file and then include it on both pages?

@XitasoChris There already is the file `/reference/forms/types/options/date_widget.rst.inc`. Can it be reused or are there slight differences between both form types?

@xabbuh The form types should be identical, but the block you pointed out has a different headline ("widget") whereas we need "date_widget" here.

@XitasoChris Indeed, I would then move the description itself to its own file.

@xabbuh Done.
