Thanks for the comments, based on the feedback I've removed the `Pluralized Translations` section, information regarding the ICU message format is specified here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/5.0/translation.rst#message-format.

@kane-menicou Thank you, but we use a tool for merging that is able to do it. So it's not really necessary for you to change it. :)
