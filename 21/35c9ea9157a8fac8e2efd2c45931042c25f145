@nabbisen thanks for this contribution!

I see this was introduced in MakerBundle in May 2019 (https://github.com/symfony/maker-bundle/commit/47ee44b23d6257684e2116da0e91184601a83370#diff-a8079906bb7a0cfe45b4b5733b0944d9). Is there any reason for adding these docs to Symfony 5.1 only? Could we merge this in 4.4 too?
