:-1: actually the Request is used just after the use statement. So it's needed after autoload...

Good. Don't we need then to add it to the first code example?

I think it's okay to remove it here. If you have a look at the file contents of the Symfony Standard Edition, you'll see that the `use` statements are placed in the part that we don't show (indicated by the `// ...` placeholders).

I agree with @xabbuh, +1
