You're trying to merge all the docs from 6.0 into 4.4 for starters. I'd suggest cherry-picking the changes you intended over to a new branch from 4.4.

@RosemaryOrchard no idea how to do that ... if someone is interested in doing it ... I'm not going to add more things ...

@arcanisgk FYI, I have changed the target branch to `6.0`. We can do the switch while merging. :)
