Wow, did you run a PHP linter on our code examples to catch all these? :) 👍

@wouterj No I did not, I was just reading the doc before catching the first one, and then I searched in all files on the repo to make sure that there is always a semicolon at the end of each use statement.

Ah, alright. Thanks for your time to check all files then! (I was thinking about automating it if you used a linter, but I don't think we can automate you 😄)

@wouterj I'll think about doing it when I have some time :D
