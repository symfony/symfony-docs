@mvar Do you have some time to add the provider check and to mark the service as private as suggested by @aitboudad?

@xabbuh I've added user provider check and marked authenticator as private.

@xabbuh @WouterJ thanks for feedback.

Added more detailed exception message and left service declaration as is.
