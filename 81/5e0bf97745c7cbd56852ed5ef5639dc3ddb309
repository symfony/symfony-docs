@pedronofuentes let me know when you think you're ready. I'll merge it into the docs then.

Btw, don't worry if you didn't catch all listings. You did a great job already! These things will finish over time.

I added these changes:

http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/service_container.html#using-the-expression-language

@WouterJ this PR looks *mergeable*, right?
