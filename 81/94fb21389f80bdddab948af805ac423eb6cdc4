Thanks for the feedback.  I wasn't sure which solution would match Symfony's style better (exception vs empty variables) and had just picked one.

I've adjusted the solution and comments.

Thanks for the feedback @ogizanagi .  It didn't occur to me that multiple authenticators could be set up, but that makes sense.
