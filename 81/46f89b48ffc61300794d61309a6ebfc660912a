Amazing! @damz thanks so much for looking into this. Now I'm sure I would have never fixed it ðŸ˜…

You can pick either this one or #7403, and it is purely a "pick your poison" question:

 * This one you will have to update the pinned dependencies from time to time, but the build is repeatable;
 * #7403 you don't have to update the dependencies (you get updated versions automatically), but that might make the build randomly fail.

We've finally decided to go for this version, so we'll close #7403 and we'll merge this soon. @damz thanks for your great help solving this issue!
