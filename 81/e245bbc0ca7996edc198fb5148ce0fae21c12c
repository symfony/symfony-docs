Maybe mention the `DeflateMarshaller` way somewhere?

BTW I've a doubt about memcache config also talking about compression.

Sure!

You can use DeflateMarshaller for Memcache too. Or what are your doubts?

I've a doubt about the memcache adapter documentation also talking about compression and I guess that if there is a global marshaller then individual adapter should not have compression option?
