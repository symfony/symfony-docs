We can't assume that users have 6.0 yet. But, the `Swift_Message` class isn't new... so does this syntax also work in Swiftmailer 5?

Also, there are other spots we need to update - you can find them if you run:

```
git grep newInstance
```

Thanks - we have to make sure the details are correct, but this is a good change. And the old way definitely does *not* work in Swiftmailer 6

Apparently, no, it's a new method to create a message in 6.0. I have read the 5.x version of the documentation and it is not the same way of doing things :
https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/blob/5.x/doc/messages.rst
So, what should I do now ? (I have committed the other spots changes)

Hmm, but check out the `Swift_Message::newInstance()` class on the 5.x branch - https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/blob/5.x/lib/classes/Swift/Message.php#L73-L76. It's not doing anything special: just creating a new instance of itself. So it looks like the docs were just not using the new method. Even going WAY back to version 4.0... I can't see a reason why we were using `newInstance` instead of simply `new Swift_Message()`.

In other words üëç - I think this is ready for merge... and into the 2.7 branch: this syntax appears to always have been valid.
