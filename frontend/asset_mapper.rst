AssetMapper: Simple, Modern CSS & JS Management
===============================================

The AssetMapper component lets you write modern JavaScript and CSS without the complexity
of using a bundler. Browsers *already* support many modern JavaScript features
like the ``import`` statement and ES6 classes. And the HTTP/2 protocol means that
combining your assets to reduce HTTP connections is no longer urgent. This component
is a light layer that helps serve your files directly to the browser.

The component has two main features:

* :ref:`Mapping & Versioning Assets <mapping-assets>`: All files inside of ``assets/``
  are made available publicly and **versioned**. You can reference
  ``assets/styles/app.css`` in a template with ``{{ asset('styles/app.css') }}``.
  The final URL will include a version hash, like ``/assets/styles/app-3c16d9220694c0e56d8648f25e6035e9.css``.

* :ref:`Importmaps <importmaps-javascript>`: A native browser feature that makes it easier
  to use the JavaScript ``import`` statement (e.g. ``import { Modal } from 'bootstrap'``)
  without a build system. It's supported in all browsers (thanks to a shim)
  and is part of the `HTML standard <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#import-maps>`_.

Installation
------------

To install the AssetMapper component, run:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ composer require symfony/asset-mapper symfony/asset symfony/twig-pack

In addition to ``symfony/asset-mapper``, this also makes sure that you have the
:doc:`Asset Component </components/asset>` and Twig available.

If you're using :ref:`Symfony Flex <symfony-flex>`, you're done! The recipe just
added a number of files:

* ``assets/app.js`` Your main JavaScript file;
* ``assets/styles/app.css`` Your main CSS file;
* ``config/packages/asset_mapper.yaml`` Where you define your asset "paths";
* ``importmap.php`` Your importmap config file.

It also *updated* the ``templates/base.html.twig`` file:

.. code-block:: diff

    {% block javascripts %}
    +    {% block importmap %}{{ importmap('app') }}{% endblock %}
    {% endblock %}

If you're not using Flex, you'll need to create & update these files manually. See
the `latest asset-mapper recipe`_ for the exact content of these files.

.. _mapping-assets:

Mapping and Referencing Assets
------------------------------

The AssetMapper component works by defining directories/paths of assets that you want to expose
publicly. These assets are then versioned and easy to reference. Thanks to the
``asset_mapper.yaml`` file, your app starts with one mapped path: the ``assets/``
directory.

If you create an ``assets/images/duck.png`` file, you can reference it in a template with:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    <img src="{{ asset('images/duck.png') }}">

The path - ``images/duck.png`` - is relative to your mapped directory (``assets/``).
This is known as the **logical path** to your asset.

If you look at the HTML in your page, the URL will be something
like: ``/assets/images/duck-3c16d9220694c0e56d8648f25e6035e9.png``. If you update
the file, the version part of the URL will change automatically!

Serving Assets in dev vs prod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``dev`` environment, the URL ``/assets/images/duck-3c16d9220694c0e56d8648f25e6035e9.png``
is handled and returned by your Symfony app.

For the ``prod`` environment, before deploy, you should run:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console asset-map:compile

This will physically copy all the files from your mapped directories to
``public/assets/`` so that they're served directly by your web server.
See :ref:`Deployment <asset-mapper-deployment>` for more details.

.. tip::

    If you need to copy the compiled assets to a different location (e.g. upload
    them to S3), create a service that implements ``Symfony\Component\AssetMapper\Path\PublicAssetsFilesystemInterface``
    and set its service id (or an alias) to ``asset_mapper.local_public_assets_filesystem``
    (to replace the built-in service).

Debugging: Seeing All Mapped Assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see all of the mapped assets in your app, run:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console debug:asset-map

This will show you all the mapped paths and the assets inside of each:

.. code-block:: text

    AssetMapper Paths
    ------------------

    --------- ------------------
     Path      Namespace prefix
    --------- ------------------
    assets

    Mapped Assets
    -------------

    ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
     Logical Path       Filesystem Path
    ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
     app.js             assets/app.js
     styles/app.css     assets/styles/app.css
     images/duck.png    assets/images/duck.png

The "Logical Path" is the path to use when referencing the asset, like
from a template.

.. _importmaps-javascript:

Importmaps & Writing JavaScript
-------------------------------

All modern browsers support the JavaScript `import statement`_ and modern
`ES6`_ features like classes. So this code "just works":

.. code-block:: javascript

    // assets/app.js
    import Duck from './duck.js';

    const duck = new Duck('Waddles');
    duck.quack();

.. code-block:: javascript

    // assets/duck.js
    export default class {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        quack() {
            console.log(`${this.name} says: Quack!`);
        }
    }

Thanks to the ``{{ importmap('app') }}`` Twig function call, which you'll learn about in
this section, the ``assets/app.js`` file is loaded & executed by the browser.

.. tip::

    When importing relative files, be sure to include the ``.js`` extension.
    Unlike in Node, the extension is required in the browser environment.

Importing 3rd Party JavaScript Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose you want to use an `npm package`_, like `bootstrap`_. Technically,
this can be done by importing its full URL, like from a CDN:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { Alert } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/+esm';

But yikes! Needing to include that URL is a pain! Instead, we can add this package
to our "importmap" via the ``importmap:require`` command. This command can be used
to add any `npm package`_:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap

This adds the ``bootstrap`` package to your ``importmap.php`` file::

    // importmap.php
    return [
        'app' => [
            'path' => './assets/app.js',
            'entrypoint' => true,
        ],
        'bootstrap' => [
            'version' => '5.3.0',
        ],
    ];

.. note::

    Sometimes, a package - like ``bootstrap`` - will have one or more dependencies,
    such as ``@popperjs/core``. The ``importmap:require`` command will add both the
    main package *and* its dependencies. If a package includes a main CSS file,
    that will also be added (see :ref:`Handling 3rd-Party CSS <asset-mapper-3rd-party-css>`).

Now you can import the ``bootstrap`` package like usual:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { Alert } from 'bootstrap';
    // ...

All packages in ``importmap.php`` are downloaded into an ``assets/vendor/`` directory,
which should be ignored by git (the Flex recipe adds it to ``.gitignore`` for you).
You'll need to run the ``php bin/console importmap:install``
command to download the files on other computers if some are missing:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console importmap:install

You can check for available updates for your third-party packages by running:

.. code-block:: terminal

    # check for updates for all packages
    $ php bin/console importmap:outdated

    # check for updates for the given list of packages
    $ php bin/console importmap:outdated bootstrap lodash

To update third-party packages in your ``importmap.php`` file, run:

.. code-block:: terminal

    # updates all packages
    $ php bin/console importmap:update

    # updates only the given list of packages
    $ php bin/console importmap:update bootstrap lodash

How does the importmap Work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How does this ``importmap.php`` file allow you to import ``bootstrap``? That's
thanks to the ``{{ importmap() }}`` Twig function in ``base.html.twig``, which
outputs an `importmap`_:

.. code-block:: html

    <script type="importmap">{
        "imports": {
            "app": "/assets/app-4e986c1a2318dd050b1d47db8d856278.js",
            "/assets/duck.js": "/assets/duck-1b7a64b3b3d31219c262cf72521a5267.js",
            "bootstrap": "/assets/vendor/bootstrap/bootstrap.index-f0935445d9c6022100863214b519a1f2.js"
        }
    }</script>

Import maps are a native browser feature. When you import ``bootstrap`` from
JavaScript, the browser will look at the ``importmap`` and see that it should
fetch the package from the associated path.

.. _automatic-import-mapping:

But where did the ``/assets/duck.js`` import entry come from? That doesn't live
in ``importmap.php``. Great question!

The ``assets/app.js`` file above imports ``./duck.js``. When you import a file using a
relative path, your browser looks for that file relative to the one importing
it. So, it would look for ``/assets/duck.js``. That URL *would* be correct,
except that the ``duck.js`` file is versioned. Fortunately, the AssetMapper component
sees the import and adds a mapping from ``/assets/duck.js`` to the correct, versioned
filename. The result: importing ``./duck.js`` just works!

The ``importmap()`` function also outputs an `ES module shim`_ so that
`older browsers <https://caniuse.com/import-maps>`_ understand importmaps
(see the :ref:`polyfill config <config-importmap-polyfill>`).

.. _app-entrypoint:

The "app" Entrypoint & Preloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An "entrypoint" is the main JavaScript file that the browser loads,
and your app starts with one by default::

    // importmap.php
    return [
        'app' => [
            'path' => './assets/app.js',
            'entrypoint' => true,
        ],
        // ...
    ];

.. _importmap-app-entry:

In addition to the importmap, the ``{{ importmap('app') }}`` in
``base.html.twig`` outputs a few other things, including:

.. code-block:: html

    <script type="module">import 'app';</script>

This line tells the browser to load the ``app`` importmap entry, which causes the
code in ``assets/app.js`` to be executed.

The ``importmap()`` function also outputs a set of "preloads":

.. code-block:: html

    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/assets/app-4e986c1a2318dd050b1d47db8d856278.js">
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/assets/duck-1b7a64b3b3d31219c262cf72521a5267.js">

This is a performance optimization and you can learn more about below
in :ref:`Performance: Add Preloading <performance-preloading>`.

Importing Specific Files From a 3rd Party Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you'll need to import a specific file from a package. For example,
suppose you're integrating `highlight.js`_ and want to import just the core
and a specific language:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import hljs from 'highlight.js/lib/core';
    import javascript from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/javascript';

    hljs.registerLanguage('javascript', javascript);
    hljs.highlightAll();

In this case, adding the ``highlight.js`` package to your ``importmap.php`` file
won't work: whatever you import - e.g. ``highlight.js/lib/core`` - needs to
*exactly* match an entry in the ``importmap.php`` file.

Instead, use ``importmap:require`` and pass it the exact paths you need. This
also shows how you can require multiple packages at once:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console importmap:require highlight.js/lib/core highlight.js/lib/languages/javascript

Global Variables like jQuery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might be accustomed to relying on global variables - like jQuery's ``$``
variable:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // assets/app.js
    import 'jquery';

    // app.js or any other file
    $('.something').hide(); // WILL NOT WORK!

But in a module environment (like with AssetMapper), when you import
a library like ``jquery``, it does *not* create a global variable. Instead, you
should import it and set it to a variable in *every* file you need it:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import $ from 'jquery';
    $('.something').hide();

You can even do this from an inline script tag:

.. code-block:: html

    <script type="module">
        import $ from 'jquery';
        $('.something').hide();
    </script>

If you *do* need something to become a global variable, you do it manually
from inside ``app.js``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import $ from 'jquery';
    // things on "window" become global variables
    window.$ = $;

Handling CSS
------------

CSS can be added to your page by importing it from a JavaScript file. The default
``assets/app.js`` already imports ``assets/styles/app.css``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // assets/app.js
    import '../styles/app.css';

    // ...

When you call ``importmap('app')`` in ``base.html.twig``, AssetMapper parses
``assets/app.js`` (and any JavaScript files that it imports) looking for ``import``
statements for CSS files. The final collection of CSS files is rendered onto
the page as ``link`` tags in the order they were imported.

.. note::

    Importing a CSS file is *not* something that is natively supported by
    JavaScript modules and normally causes an error. AssetMapper makes this
    work by adding an importmap entry for each CSS file that is valid, but
    does nothing. AssetMapper adds a ``link`` tag for each CSS file, but when
    the JavaScript executes the ``import`` statement, nothing additional happens.

.. _asset-mapper-3rd-party-css:

Handling 3rd-Party CSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a JavaScript package will contain one or more CSS files. For example,
the ``bootstrap`` package has a `dist/css/bootstrap.min.css file`_.

You can require CSS files in the same way as JavaScript files:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css

To include it on the page, import it from a JavaScript file:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // assets/app.js
    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

    // ...

.. tip::

    Some packages - like ``bootstrap`` - advertise that they contain a CSS
    file. In those cases, when you ``importmap:require bootstrap``, the
    CSS file is also added to ``importmap.php`` for convenience.

Paths Inside of CSS Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From inside CSS, you can reference other files using the normal CSS ``url()``
function and a relative path to the target file:

.. code-block:: css

    /* assets/styles/app.css */
    .quack {
        /* file lives at assets/images/duck.png */
        background-image: url('../images/duck.png');
    }

The path in the final ``app.css`` file will automatically include the versioned URL
for ``duck.png``:

.. code-block:: css

    /* public/assets/styles/app-3c16d9220694c0e56d8648f25e6035e9.css */
    .quack {
        background-image: url('../images/duck-3c16d9220694c0e56d8648f25e6035e9.png');
    }

.. _asset-mapper-tailwind:

Using Tailwind CSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the `Tailwind`_ CSS framework with the AssetMapper component, check out
`symfonycasts/tailwind-bundle`_.

.. _asset-mapper-sass:

Using Sass
~~~~~~~~~~

To use Sass with AssetMapper component, check out `symfonycasts/sass-bundle`_.

Lazily Importing CSS from a JavaScript File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have some CSS that you want to load lazily, you can do that via
the normal, "dynamic" import syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // assets/any-file.js
    import('./lazy.css');

    // ...

In this case, ``lazy.css`` will be downloaded asynchronously and then added to
the page. If you use a dynamic import to lazily-load a JavaScript file and that
file imports a CSS file (using the non-dynamic ``import`` syntax), that CSS file
will also be downloaded asynchronously.

Issues and Debugging
--------------------

There are a few common errors and problems you might run into.

Missing importmap Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most common errors will come from your browser's console, and
will look something like this:

    Failed to resolve module specifier "    bootstrap". Relative references must start
    with either "/", "./", or "../".

Or:

    The specifier "bootstrap" was a bare specifier, but was not remapped to anything.
    Relative module specifiers must start with "./", "../" or "/".

This means that, somewhere in your JavaScript, you're importing a 3rd party
package - e.g. ``import 'bootstrap'``. The browser tries to find this
package in your ``importmap`` file, but it's not there.

The fix is almost always to add it to your ``importmap``:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap

.. note::

    Some browsers, like Firefox, show *where* this "import" code lives, while
    others like Chrome currently do not.

404 Not Found for a JavaScript, CSS or Image File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a JavaScript file you're importing (e.g. ``import './duck.js'``),
or a CSS/image file you're referencing won't be found, and you'll see a 404
error in your browser's console. You'll also notice that the 404 URL is missing
the version hash in the filename (e.g. a 404 to ``/assets/duck.js`` instead of
a path like ``/assets/duck.1b7a64b3b3d31219c262cf72521a5267.js``).

This is usually because the path is wrong. If you're referencing the file
directly in a Twig template:

.. code-block:: html+twig

        <img src="{{ asset('images/duck.png') }}">

Then the path that you pass ``asset()`` should be the "logical path" to the
file. Use the ``debug:asset-map`` command to see all valid logical paths
in your app.

More likely, you're importing the failing asset from a CSS file (e.g.
``@import url('other.css')``) or a JavaScript file:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // assets/controllers/farm-controller.js
    import '../farm/chicken.js';

When doing this, the path should be *relative* to the file that's importing it
(and, in JavaScript files, should start with ``./`` or ``../``). In this case,
``../farm/chicken.js`` would point to ``assets/farm/chicken.js``. To
see a list of *all* invalid imports in your app, run:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console cache:clear
    $ php bin/console debug:asset-map

Any invalid imports will show up as warnings on top of the screen (make sure
you have ``symfony/monolog-bundle`` installed):

.. code-block:: text

    WARNING   [asset_mapper] Unable to find asset "../images/ducks.png" referenced in "assets/styles/app.css".
    WARNING   [asset_mapper] Unable to find asset "./ducks.js" imported from "assets/app.js".

Missing Asset Warnings on Commented-out Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AssetMapper component looks in your JavaScript files for ``import`` lines so
that it can :ref:`automatically add them to your importmap <automatic-import-mapping>`.
This is done via regex and works very well, though it isn't perfect. If you
comment-out an import, it will still be found and added to your importmap. That
doesn't harm anything, but could be surprising.

If the imported path cannot be found, you'll see warning log when that asset
is being built, which you can ignore.

.. _asset-mapper-deployment:

Deploying with the AssetMapper Component
----------------------------------------

When you're ready to deploy, "compile" your assets during deployment:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console asset-map:compile

That's it! This will write all your assets into the ``public/assets/`` directory,
along with a few JSON files so that the ``importmap`` can be rendered lightning fast.

But to make sure your site is performant, be sure that your web server
(or a proxy) is running HTTP/2, is compressing your assets and setting
long-lived Expires headers on them. See :ref:`Optimization <optimization>` for
more details.

.. _optimization:

Optimizing Performance
----------------------

To make your AssetMapper-powered site fly, there are a few things you need to
do. If you want to take a shortcut, you can use a service like `Cloudflare`_,
which will automatically do most of these things for you:

- **Use HTTP/2**: Your web server **must** be running HTTP/2 (or HTTP/3) so the
  browser can download assets in parallel. HTTP/2 is automatically enabled in Caddy
  and can be activated in Nginx and Apache. Or, proxy your site through a
  service like Cloudflare, which will automatically enable HTTP/2 for you.

- **Compress your assets**: Your web server should compress (e.g. using gzip)
  your assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) before sending them to the browser. This
  is automatically enabled in Caddy and can be activated in Nginx and Apache.
  Or, proxy your site through a service like Cloudflare, which will
  automatically compress your assets for you. In Cloudflare, you can also
  enable `auto minify`_ to further compress your assets (e.g. removing
  whitespace and comments from JavaScript and CSS files).

- **Set long-lived Expires headers**: Your web server should set long-lived
  Expires headers on your assets. Because the AssetMapper component includes a version
  hash in the filename of each asset, you can safely set the Expires header
  to a very long time in the future (e.g. 1 year). This isn't automatic in
  any web server, but can be easily enabled.

Once you've done these things, you can use a tool like `Lighthouse`_ to
validate the performance of your site!

.. _performance-preloading:

Performance: Understanding Preloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One issue that LightHouse may report is:

    Avoid Chaining Critical Requests

To understand the problem, imagine this theoretical setup:

- ``assets/app.js`` imports ``./duck.js``
- ``assets/duck.js`` imports ``bootstrap``

Without preloading, when the browser downloads the page, the following would happen:

1. The browser downloads ``assets/app.js``;
2. It *then* sees the ``./duck.js`` import and downloads ``assets/duck.js``;
3. It *then* sees the ``bootstrap`` import and downloads ``assets/bootstrap.js``.

Instead of downloading all 3 files in parallel, the browser would be forced to
download them one-by-one as it discovers them. That would hurt performance.

AssetMapper avoids this problem by outputting "preload" ``link`` tags.
The logic works like this:

**A) When you call ``importmap('app')`` in your template**, the AssetMapper component
looks at the ``assets/app.js`` file and finds all of the JavaScript files
that it imports or files that those files import, etc.

**B) It then outputs a ``link`` tag** for each of those files with a ``rel="preload"``
attribute. This tells the browser to start downloading those files immediately,
even though it hasn't yet seen the ``import`` statement for them.

Additionally, if the :doc:`WebLink Component </web_link>` is available in your application,
Symfony will add a ``Link`` header in the response to preload the CSS files.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Does the AssetMapper Component Combine Assets?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nope! But that's because this is no longer necessary!

In the past, it was common to combine assets to reduce the number of HTTP
requests that were made. Thanks to advances in web servers like
HTTP/2, it's typically not a problem to keep your assets separate and let the
browser download them in parallel. In fact, by keeping them separate, when
you update one asset, the browser can continue to use the cached version of
all of your other assets.

See :ref:`Optimization <optimization>` for more details.

Does the AssetMapper Component Minify Assets?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nope! Minifying or compressing assets *is* important, but can be
done by your web server or a service like Cloudflare. See
:ref:`Optimization <optimization>` for more details.

Is the AssetMapper Component Production Ready? Is it Performant?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes! Very! The AssetMapper component leverages advances in browser technology (like
importmaps and native ``import`` support) and web servers (like HTTP/2, which allows
assets to be downloaded in parallel). See the other questions about minimization
and combination and :ref:`Optimization <optimization>` for more details.

The https://ux.symfony.com site runs on the AssetMapper component and has a 99%
Google Lighthouse score.

Does the AssetMapper Component work in All Browsers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes! Features like importmaps and the ``import`` statement are supported
in all modern browsers, but the AssetMapper component ships with an `ES module shim`_
to support ``importmap`` in old browsers. So, it works everywhere (see note
below).

Inside your own code, if you're relying on modern `ES6`_ JavaScript features
like the `class syntax`_, this is supported in all but the oldest browsers.
If you *do* need to support very old browsers, you should use a tool like
:ref:`Encore <frontend-webpack-encore>` instead of the AssetMapper component.

.. note::

    The `import statement`_ can't be polyfilled or shimmed to work on *every*
    browser. However, only the **oldest** browsers don't support it - basically
    IE 11 (which is no longer supported by Microsoft and has less than .4%
    of global usage).

    The ``importmap`` feature **is** shimmed to work in **all** browsers by the
    AssetMapper component. However, the shim doesn't work with "dynamic" imports:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        // this works
        import { add } from './math.js';

        // this will not work in the oldest browsers
        import('./math.js').then(({ add }) => {
            // ...
        });

    If you want to use dynamic imports and need to support certain older browsers
    (https://caniuse.com/import-maps), you can use an ``importShim()`` function
    from the shim: https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-module-shims#user-content-polyfill-edge-case-dynamic-import

Can I Use it with Sass or Tailwind?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sure! See :ref:`Using Tailwind CSS <asset-mapper-tailwind>` or :ref:`Using Sass <asset-mapper-sass>`.

Can I Use it with TypeScript?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sure! See :ref:`Using TypeScript <asset-mapper-ts>`.

Can I Use it with JSX or Vue?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probably not. And if you're writing an application in React, Svelte or another
frontend framework, you'll probably be better off using *their* tools directly.

JSX *can* be compiled directly to a native JavaScript file but if you're using a lot of JSX,
you'll probably want to use a tool like :ref:`Encore <frontend-webpack-encore>`.
See the `UX React Documentation`_ for more details about using it with the AssetMapper
component.

Vue files *can* be written in native JavaScript, and those *will* work with
the AssetMapper component. But you cannot write single-file components (i.e. ``.vue``
files) with component, as those must be used in a build system. See the
`UX Vue.js Documentation`_ for more details about using with the AssetMapper
component.

Using TypeScript
----------------

To use TypeScript with the AssetMapper component, check out `sensiolabs/typescript-bundle`_.

Third-Party Bundles & Custom Asset Paths
----------------------------------------

All bundles that have a ``Resources/public/`` or ``public/`` directory will
automatically have that directory added as an "asset path", using the namespace:
``bundles/<BundleName>``. For example, if you're using `BabdevPagerfantaBundle`_
and you run the ``debug:asset-map`` command, you'll see an asset whose logical
path is ``bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta.css``.

This means you can render these assets in your templates using the
``asset()`` function:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta.css') }}">

Actually, this path - ``bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta.css`` - already
works in applications *without* the AssetMapper component, because the ``assets:install``
command copies the assets from bundles into ``public/bundles/``. However, when
the AssetMapper component is enabled, the ``pagerfanta.css`` file will automatically
be versioned! It will output something like:

.. code-block:: html+twig

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta-ea64fc9c55f8394e696554f8aeb81a8e.css">

Overriding 3rd-Party Assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to override a 3rd-party asset, you can do that by creating a
file in your ``assets/`` directory with the same name. For example, if you
want to override the ``pagerfanta.css`` file, create a file at
``assets/bundles/babdevpagerfanta/css/pagerfanta.css``. This file will be
used instead of the original file.

.. note::

    If a bundle renders their *own* assets, but they use a non-default
    :ref:`asset package <asset-packages>`, then the AssetMapper component will
    not be used. This happens, for example, with `EasyAdminBundle`_.

Importing Assets Outside of the ``assets/`` Directory
-----------------------------------------------------

You *can* import assets that live outside of your asset path
(i.e. the ``assets/`` directory). For example:

.. code-block:: css

    /* assets/styles/app.css */

    /* you can reach above assets/ */
    @import url('../../vendor/babdev/pagerfanta-bundle/Resources/public/css/pagerfanta.css');

However, if you get an error like this:

    The "app" importmap entry contains the path "vendor/some/package/assets/foo.js"
    but it does not appear to be in any of your asset paths.

It means that you're pointing to a valid file, but that file isn't in any of
your asset paths. You can fix this by adding the path to your ``asset_mapper.yaml``
file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # config/packages/asset_mapper.yaml
    framework:
        asset_mapper:
            paths:
                - assets/
                - vendor/some/package/assets

Then try the command again.

Configuration Options
---------------------

You can see every available configuration options and some info by running:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console config:dump framework asset_mapper

Some of the more important options are described below.

``framework.asset_mapper.paths``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This config holds all of the directories that will be scanned for assets. This
can be a simple list:

.. code-block:: yaml

    framework:
        asset_mapper:
            paths:
                - assets/
                - vendor/some/package/assets

Or you can give each path a "namespace" that will be used in the asset map:

.. code-block:: yaml

    framework:
        asset_mapper:
            paths:
                assets/: ''
                vendor/some/package/assets/: 'some-package'

In this case, the "logical path" to all of the files in the ``vendor/some/package/assets/``
directory will be prefixed with ``some-package`` - e.g. ``some-package/foo.js``.

.. _excluded_patterns:

``framework.asset_mapper.excluded_patterns``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a list of glob patterns that will be excluded from the asset map:

.. code-block:: yaml

    framework:
        asset_mapper:
            excluded_patterns:
                - '*/*.scss'

You can use the ``debug:asset-map`` command to double-check that the files
you expect are being included in the asset map.

``framework.asset_mapper.exclude_dotfiles``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether to exclude any file starting with a ``.`` from the asset mapper. This
is useful if you want to avoid leaking sensitive files like ``.env`` or
``.gitignore`` in the files published by the asset mapper.

.. code-block:: yaml

    framework:
        asset_mapper:
            exclude_dotfiles: true

This option is enabled by default.

.. _config-importmap-polyfill:

``framework.asset_mapper.importmap_polyfill``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the polyfill for older browsers. By default, the `ES module shim`_ is loaded
via a CDN. You can pass the key of an item in ``importmap.php`` or ``false`` to disable
the polyfill loading.

.. code-block:: yaml

    framework:
        asset_mapper:
            importmap_polyfill: false # disable the shim ...
            # importmap_polyfill: 'my_import_map' # ... or pass an importmap name

.. tip::

    You can tell the AssetMapper to load the `ES module shim`_ locally by
    using the following command, without changing your configuration:

    .. code-block:: terminal

        $ php bin/console importmap:require es-module-shims

``framework.asset_mapper.importmap_script_attributes``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a list of attributes that will be added to the ``<script>`` tags
rendered by the ``{{ importmap() }}`` Twig function:

.. code-block:: yaml

    framework:
        asset_mapper:
            importmap_script_attributes:
                crossorigin: 'anonymous'

Page-Specific CSS & JavaScript
------------------------------

Sometimes you may choose to include CSS or JavaScript files only on certain
pages. For JavaScript, an easy way is to load the file with a `dynamic import`_:

.. code-block:: javascript

    const someCondition = '...';
    if (someCondition) {
        import('./some-file.js');

        // or use async/await
        // const something = await import('./some-file.js');
    }

Another option is to create a separate :ref:`entrypoint <app-entrypoint>`. For
example, create a ``checkout.js`` file that contains whatever JavaScript and
CSS you need:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // assets/checkout.js
    import './checkout.css';

    // ...

Next, add this to ``importmap.php`` and mark it as an entrypoint::

    // importmap.php
    return [
        // the 'app' entrypoint ...

        'checkout' => [
            'path' => './assets/checkout.js',
            'entrypoint' => true,
        ],
    ];

Finally, on the page that needs this JavaScript, call ``importmap()`` and pass
both ``app`` and ``checkout``:

.. code-block:: twig

    {# templates/products/checkout.html.twig #}
    {#
        Override an "importmap" block in base.html.twig.
        If you don't have this, add it around the {{ importmap('app') }} call.
    #}
    {% block importmap %}
        {# do NOT call parent() #}

        {{ importmap(['app', 'checkout']) }}
    {% endblock %}

By passing both ``app`` and ``checkout``, the ``importmap()`` function will
output the ``importmap`` and also add a ``<script type="module">`` tag that
loads the ``app.js`` file *and* the ``checkout.js`` file. It's important
to *not* call ``parent()`` in the ``importmap`` block. Each page can only
have *one* importmap, so ``importmap()`` must be called exactly once.

If, for some reason, you want to execute *only* ``checkout.js``
and *not* ``app.js``, pass only ``checkout`` to ``importmap()``.

The AssetMapper Component Caching System in dev
-----------------------------------------------

When developing your app in debug mode, the AssetMapper component will calculate the
content of each asset file and cache it. Whenever that file changes, the component
will automatically re-calculate the content.

The system also accounts for "dependencies": If ``app.css`` contains
``@import url('other.css')``, then the ``app.css`` file contents will also be
re-calculated whenever ``other.css`` changes. This is because the version hash of ``other.css``
will change... which will cause the final content of ``app.css`` to change, since
it includes the final ``other.css`` filename inside.

Mostly, this system just works. But if you have a file that is not being
re-calculated when you expect it to, you can run:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console cache:clear

This will force the AssetMapper component to re-calculate the content of all files.

Run Security Audits on Your Dependencies
----------------------------------------

Similar to ``npm``, the AssetMapper component comes bundled with a
command that checks security vulnerabilities in the dependencies of your application:

.. code-block:: terminal

    $ php bin/console importmap:audit

    --------  ---------------------------------------------  ---------  -------  ----------  -----------------------------------------------------
    Severity  Title                                          Package    Version  Patched in  More info

    --------  ---------------------------------------------  ---------  -------  ----------  -----------------------------------------------------

    7 packages found: 7 audited / 0 skipped
    6 vulnerabilities found: 1 Critical / 1 High / 4 Medium

The command will return the ``0`` exit code if no vulnerability is found, or
the ``1`` exit code otherwise. This means that you can seamlessly integrate this
command as part of your CI to be warned anytime a new vulnerability is found.

.. tip::

    The command takes a ``--format`` option to choose the output format between
    ``txt`` and ``json``.
