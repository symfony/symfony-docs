Thanks @javiereguiluz! I've applied your suggestions and added the missing screenshot.

Thanks @xabbuh! I've applied most of your suggestions. I'm going to ask Fabien about the 2.8 release, as I think it's quite logical if it'll always be the case and exceptions would make this doc harder to understand.

Thanks everyone. I've now updated this PR

We just need to find a consensus on whether or not to do the split (see #5186).

@WouterJ I suggested some changes. I don't feel strongly, but my preference is to have an install *and* an upgrade section, mostly because upgrade is *so* important (install is actually less important, people will generally go elsewhere - e.g. symfony.com/download - to install) that I don't want to have to hide it under a "Install and Upgrade" section.

Thanks @weaverryan. I've fixed them. I also think we should have a seperate upgrade section.
