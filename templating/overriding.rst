How to Override Templates from Third-Party Bundles
==================================================

The Symfony community prides itself on creating and maintaining high quality
bundles (see `KnpBundles.com`_) for a large number of different features.
Once you use a third-party bundle, you'll likely need to override and customize
one or more of its templates.

Suppose you've installed an imaginary open-source AcmeBlogBundle in your
project. And while you're really happy with everything, you want to override
the template for a blog list page. Inside the bundle, the template you want to
override lives at ``Resources/views/Blog/index.html.twig``.

To override the bundle template, just copy the ``index.html.twig`` template
from the bundle to ``app/Resources/AcmeBlogBundle/views/Blog/index.html.twig``
(the ``app/Resources/AcmeBlogBundle`` directory won't exist, so you'll need
to create it). You're now free to customize the template.

  Instead of overridding an entire template, you may just want to override one or more blocks. You can do that by extending the original
  template using the "!" prefix. For example:
  ``{% extends "@!AcmeBlogBundle/layout.html.twig" %}``

.. caution::

    If you add a template in a new location, you *may* need to clear your
    cache (``php bin/console cache:clear``), even if you are in debug mode.

This logic also applies to *any* template that lives in a bundle: just follow the
convention: ``app/Resources/{BUNDLE_NAME}/views/{PATH/TO/TEMPLATE.html.twig}``.

.. note::

    You can also override templates from within a bundle by using bundle
    inheritance. For more information, see :doc:`/bundles/inheritance`.

Overriding Core Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the Symfony Framework itself is just a bundle, core templates can be
overridden in the same way. For example, the core TwigBundle contains a number
of different "exception" and "error" templates that can be overridden by
copying each from the ``Resources/views/Exception`` directory of the TwigBundle
to, you guessed it, the ``app/Resources/TwigBundle/views/Exception`` directory.
