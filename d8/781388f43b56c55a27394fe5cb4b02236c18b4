@javiereguiluz It was tricky when I talked about bind for the controller args... as I could have shown a bind on *just* that one service (a bit more clear... but kinda less useful) or apply a bind to `_defaults`, which is *awesome*, but might be a little less clear. I'm not sure what the right thing is.

But, we will of course talk about that a lot more in the `service_container.rst` chapter... which I hope we will turn into a "getting started" guide ;)
