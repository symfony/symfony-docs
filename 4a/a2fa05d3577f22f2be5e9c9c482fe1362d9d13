I'm sorry but I don't know the internals of this well. Maybe @tucksaun can help us because he set up the SymfonyCloud integration and because he knows everything about SymfonyCloud. Thanks!

Just ported what used to be on Platform.sh to SymfonyCloud, so sorry I can't tell either 🤷‍♂

Actually, according to https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/commit/75e717732dfa8f2f2d1daa10c36db54c55935952:

> **Pin Python dependencies and install them in a virtualenv**
> Installing `sphinx` started to fail about a week ago,
with `pip` incorrectly trying to remove a Python package
shipped at the system level in Platform.sh environment.

So that would be why

Ok, but in this case we could add them to the `.requirements.txt` file? right?

Lets see if it works

Probably not because this is a usual command to upgrade `pip` and then used this updated `pip` version.

Unfortunately in this PR there is no SymfonyCloud env deployed. Do we raise the allowed number of ENVs? Or can you force this PR to deploy? @tucksaun

Sounds reasonable

I dropped the package move, so no blocker here for now. We are good to go

Actually it is deployed... don't know why the status is not updated 🤔
