I prefer to move this to `components/asset/introduction.html` (I would like to do this for all components in the future).

@WouterJ I completely agree with you. In 9c456e3 I've moved the documentation of the Asset component to `components/asset/*`

@javiereguiluz is there any reason you closed all your open PRs and removed all your branches?

@WouterJ yes of course, there is a very simple explanation: I'm completely stupid :(  I was doing other things and I indadvertedly deleted everything. Please tell me that we can fix this mess somehow.

It seems that we can tag this PR as *finished*. Thanks.
