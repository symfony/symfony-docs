Is this code already available in Symfony 4.4?

Using blame to look at /Adapter/ExtLdap/Query.php in the callSearchFunction line shows that there was a refactor on 2020-10-07, but that the code that was refactored had `$this->options['filter']` already at that point.

I'm seeing this as far back as 3 years ago, so I'm feeling like it was available in 4.4.
