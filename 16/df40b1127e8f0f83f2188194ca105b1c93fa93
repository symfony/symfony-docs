Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.4, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Jesse, thanks for this contribution. However, it was sent to `5.0` branch, which is no longer maintained. These are the currently maintained branches: https://symfony.com/releases#maintained-symfony-branches Thanks!

@javiereguiluz should we target 4.4 here or do we need 5.4 ?
