I agree that the original wording is not perfectly clear ... but the new proposed wording isn't much better to me. @OskarStark what do you think about this? Thanks.

I agree with Shrey and with you, what about:

```diff
- This article explains how to create and load those bundle services files.
+ This article explains how to create and load service files from the bundle directory structure.
```

I really like this @OskarStark. Only minor suggestion from me would be:

- From your suggestion: This article explains how to create and load service files from the bundle directory structure.
+ To: This article explains how to create and load service files using the bundle directory structure.

How is that? //cc @javiereguiluz

Yes, I like the new proposals. The latest from @shreypuranik sound better to me, but both are great. Thank you!
