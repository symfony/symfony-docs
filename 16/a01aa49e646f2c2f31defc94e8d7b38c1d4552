@shreypuranik thanks for this contribution!

The way I understood your contribution is like this: "be careful, if you add this command and there are vulnerabilities, the build will fail". The way it's explained looks like a bad thing ... but that's precisely what we want to emphasize: add this command to your CI, because when there are vulnerabilities, it will fail.

I've reworded it a bit to make this more clear. Is it OK to you? Thanks.

Hi @javiereguiluz, thanks for reviewing so promptly. I completely agree with your amended commit, as it certainly reads a lot more transparently. I have added a minor line to emphasise the non-zero exit code. Hope thats ok? Thanks,

@shreypuranik I'm afraid I don't agree with your last proposal ðŸ˜“  I think it's redundant with the first phrase, which also talks about non-zero exit code.

@javiereguiluz Thanks for reviewing. I have just pushed up a further commit which removes the additional line about the non-zero exit code.
