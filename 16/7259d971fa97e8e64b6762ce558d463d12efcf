> FI, [Unit] section of service allow "Requires=" which could be set to prevent failure from dependency not meet a startup

What would you suggest as a Requires? ``After=network.target rabbitmq.service`` something like that? I don't do that for my services atm

Please merge this, as I was looking days for a solution on supervisor. Thanks to @tvlooy we managed to implement the wrapper script which added the needed delay between restarts. As the PR for supervisor does not provide this.
https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/487

So a merge would be nice for the world to know :)
