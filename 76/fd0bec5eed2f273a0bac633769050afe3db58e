The PR is ready :slightly_smiling_face: I took every topic of the README and integrated it. I also updated with your suggested changes @dunglas, thank you :+1:

I think we should target 6.4 branch, because symfony/panther:5.4 will never exist ðŸ¤”

Rebased on 6.4 :+1:

@dunglas is this PR ready from your side?

Are you planing to move panther to Symfony 6.4 or later?

@OskarStark I think that in 6.4/7.0 we can no longer make any changes because their release is imminent (3 weeks).
