You didn't really document `$flatten`, did you?

Also, I would be a bit more detailed about the iterator returned. That it extends `RecursiveIterator`, so you can iterator recursively over all form errors.

Also, we still miss some lines on converting the object to a string to get a nice overview.

Everything starting with line 669 is about ``$flatten``. Though I agree with you about the ``RecursiveIterator``.

What way do you suggest to convert it to a string? I guess there is no easy way.

@WouterJ I changed the example to make use of a ``RecursiveIteratorIterator``. I think a ``RecursiveTreeIterator`` isn't really applicable in the web context (e.g. it doesn't look nice). It might be useful in console applications but probably you wouldn't use forms there.

I guess this is finished but we need for #4168 here.

This needs to be rebased now that the other PR has been merged

@stof Yes, I also need do some other modifications tonight.

Any opinion on this?
