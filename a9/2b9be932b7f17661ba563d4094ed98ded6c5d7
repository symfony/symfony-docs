@ostark the syntax of your article is mostly right. However, we need lines to be wrapped at around 80 characters (we don't use "soft wraps" at the Symfony docs). Thanks!

Although I don't have experience with fortrabbit, the article looked very informative and easy to follow. I've left some minor comments but overall I'm :+1: for including this article. Thanks @ostark.

@ostark Sorry, I didn't have a enough time to finish my review yesterday. I did that now and left some more minor comments. Overall, the article looks very well (I cannot say anything about how that works as I didn't use fortrabbit yet though).

@xabbuh Thanks again for taking care! I hope I didn't messed up anything.
