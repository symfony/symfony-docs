:+1: Why not? Consistency is always nice in the docs.

@kix We need however take into account that someone might already refer to the old headline. Therefore we should add a label to keep the old anchor working. Can you please add one just before the headline? It would basically then look like this ("are" should actually be capitalised too):

```rst
.. _understand-how-console-arguments-are-handled:

Understanding how Console Arguments Are Handled
===============================================
```
