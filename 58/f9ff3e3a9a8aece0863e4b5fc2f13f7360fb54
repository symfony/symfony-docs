This is part of the coding standards actually (and I'm quite sure it is already documented)

I didn't see any entry about this @stof: https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html

I thought it was mentioned. Can you update your PR to mention it on this page instead then ?

@stof, updated.

@stof @phansys BTW, having a little more explanation of why this choice on the docs would be useful for non adept developers. :+1:

Regarding to [WordPress coding style](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/#yoda-conditions) from where Yoda condition from (AFAIK):

> Yoda conditions for <, >, <= or >= are significantly more difficult to read and are best avoided.

Is I understand well, Yoda condition **should** be avoided for `<`, `>`, `<=` or `>=`, isn't it?

If yes, it should be clearly specified on this doc too.
