After submit this PR, I noticed that this should applied to 2.3+ (I made the PR to 2.8), should I close this and submit a new PR from 2.3?

:+1: Perfect pull request!

By the way, you don't need to worry about the right target branch. We have a nice tool that we use to merge which is able to do the rebase when merging.
