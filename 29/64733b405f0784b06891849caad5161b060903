No probs, just stumbled across the merged PR and then the docs PR when looking for the answer. If I do this in future, is 1 PR sufficient until approved in master and then PR for the other versions? Didn't really think about it before submitting them all.

should we take over this PR? or are you ok to finish it @silverbackdan ?

@nicolas-grekas I'm sorry for leaving this - I've made the update to use the versionadd block now. I updated the wording on that file too.
